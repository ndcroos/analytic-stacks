e  so  today  I  want  to  uh  before  Dustin
takes  over  on  Wednesday  again  uh  today  I
want  to  give  some  some  compliments  on
solid
modules  sorry
being  so  just  briefly  recall  the
definition  so  with  P  has  always  denoted
the  subjective  object  which  is  as  a  fre
guy  on  the  nor
sequence  and  uh  then  we  consider  this
anamorphism  of  P  which  is  the  identity
minus  the  shift
n  which  takes  the  generator  n  to  n+  One
n  and
then
the  new  definition  of  a  solid  module  was
thatal  to  the  old  definition  but  on  prly
so  solid
is  Ed  by  F  on  interal
home
morphism  where  intuitively  speaking  this
is  a  map  I  mean  M  from  P  to  n  some  of
the  space  of  n  sequences  in
N  so  you  take  a  n  sequence  in  n  and  to
the  sequence  of
differential  and  intuitively  speaking
that  this  is  an  isomorphism  means  that
conversely  if  you  have  any  more  sequence
than  M  then  you  can  sum  it  because  if
you  think  about  it  then  this  m  Z  must  be
the  sum  of
all  so  so  this  looks  like  some
definition  of  derived
complete  modules  like  periodically
derived  complete  so  I  suppose  there  is
some  mathematical  relation  that  derived
complete  let  let  me  talk  a  little  bit
about  uh  little  bit  of
yeah  uh
I  mean  I  think  on  the  face  of  it  it's
not  related  but  okay  so  there  will  be
some  dve  complet  this  today  um  and  so
then  the  theorem  we  proved  last  time  was
that  uh  this  PO  guys  and  try  all
good
be  stable  under  all
fourel
extensions  let  me  just  say  limits  or
coits
um  tend
product
product  making  the  left
joint  so  this  inclusion  L
join
um  oh
solidification  um  making  this  left  joint
symmetri  mon  meaning  Comm
product  and  uh  it  is  is
generated  by  a  single  compact  projective
object
um  this  is  a
product
and  on  this
generator
uh  the  Sol  tender
product  is
justes
um  and  maybe  the  other  thing  I  should
say  is  that  one  can  compute  on  the
solidification  of  all  these  three
modules  on  a  Prof  finite  set  s  they  are
just  the
limit  of  the  three  modules  on  the  finite
set
and  okay  so  I  think  this  basically
summarizes  starting  from  last
time  and
uh
maybe  okay  what's  the  first  thing  maybe
the  first
thing  okay  then  then  let  me  first  uh
discuss  the  derived  enhancement  of  the
situation
um
um  so  let's  let's  assume  that  instead  of
uh
just  just  one  Con  in  group  you  really
have  not
Tak  then  actually  the  definition  still
makes
sense  and  we  take  that  as  a  definition
so  we  say  that  a  complex  of  like  which
is  solid
if
again  internal
alism  but  again  because  the  internal  H
from  p  is  actually  exact  this  actually
equivalent  to  asking
uh  that  for  all  I  in
the  the  internal
home  from
theology  so  there's  equivalent  to  asking
that  uh  all  the  homologies  of  a
also
and  again  this  is  also  true  uh  in  our
previous  discussion  of  s  being  groups
and  is  in  fact  a  general  property  for  we
call  an  analytic  R  structure  that  you
can  check  completeness  of  the  level  ofy
groups  classically  this  is  a  little
subtle  to  prove  but  here  again  it's  an
immediate  consequence  of  the  internal
projectivity  of
key
okay  so
uh  then  some  of  cor  area  of  this  C  said
uh
um  the  class  of  sub  solid  a  is  itself  a
triangulated
subcategory  or  if  you  would  work  in  the
infinity  setting  it  would  be  a
stable  inity
uh
and  stable  under  all
direct  and
so  all  liit  and
liit
uh
and  and  also  one  can  again  show  it's
also
stable  under  our
home  uh  and  again  from  same  proof  as
last  time  and  then  if  you  just  repeat
this  discussion  of  tender  products  now
at  the  level  of  deriv  categories  uh  you
actually  see
that
um  oh  actually  it's  also  true  that  uh
so  I  did  give  a  notation  to  the
subcategory  uh  and  I  didn't  want  to  give
itation  because  in  the  end  it  just  turns
out  that  if  you  take  the  drive  category
of  solid  guys  um  then  drive  C  are
functorial  so  you  get  a
map
this  is  actually  F
faceful  and  the  essential
image  ex  a  solid
base  this  is  actually  something  that's
not  completely  automatic  this  uses  that
um  these  project  generators  here  that
they
stay  they  some  have  exp  banishing  also
in  light  condens  being  groups  Orly
that's  the  solidification  actually  here
is
okay
um
uh  so  is  it  the  case  that  if  you  have
any  complex  possibly  unbounded  whose
terms  are  direct  sums  of  those
generators  these  generators  and  the  the
taking  solidification  turn  by  ter  is  is
a  good  arve  that  that  gives  you  the
yes  yes  that's
right
okay  I  yeah  solidification  preserves
like  on  the  level
of  for  more  maybe  forget  about
uh  the  thing  so  then  you  have  this  whole
sub  category  in  the  dra  of  see  solid
objects  and  again  by  thej  function  you
will  actually  incl  will  have  left  joint
some  kind  of  dve  solidification
fun  uh  which  again  will  commute  with  all
Co  elements  back  into  because  this  is
still  under  alls  and  then  this  and  on
the  generator  we  kind  of  determined  what
it  does  last  time  that  it  comes  this
thing  even  in  the  d  s  uh  so
yeah  um
okay  so  uh  also  also  on  the  of  D
categories  we  have  a  full  inclusion
really  um  so  it's  as  nice  as  it  could  be
and  uh  and  again  by  some  my  joint  fun
serum  uh  this  has  a  left
joint  hey  nothing  to  let  me  write  this  a
deriv  solidification
L
box  so  in  the  joint  Factor  theorem
usually  there  is  some  set
theoretical  condition  because  you  want
thatly  I'm  thinking  of  everything  as
Infinity  categories  and  then  everything
here  is  this  presentable  Infinity
category  and  then  L  has  this  general
joint  fun  serum  there  I  think  there  are
for  tri  categories  there  are  Ser  of  nean
and  others  which  would  also  to  justify
this  I  believe  uh  but  I  mean  they  often
assume  actual  compact  generation  which
is  not  quite  true  in  this  Cas  so  I'm  not
sure  but  L  version  is  definitely
sufficient  okay  so  so  for  B  for  would
need  the  abstract  Z  because  we  can  just
prove  the  existence  by  hand  in  this  case
because  on  on  a  class  of  generators  we
can  we  have  identified  that  the  exists
these  guys  already  know  that  they  exist
but  the  abstract  theorem  is  both  for
Left  Eye  joint  and  right  eye  joints
assuming  that  there  are  enough  limits
and  Co  limits  right  I  mean  so  there  one
of  presentable  Infinity  category  which
is  one  which  has  all  Co  limits  and  which
is  generated  by  the  set  of  objects  um
and  in  this  situation  every  functor  that
preserves  all  col  is  R
joint  and  every  functor  that  preserves
all  limits  and  all  sufficiently  filtered
full
limits  also
all  sufficiently  filtered  coits  so  it's
accessible  one
also
um  uh  and  uh  a
unique
uh  symmetric
product  prodct
um
making  uh  a  goes  to
R  and  actually  something  even  better  to
that  this  is  literally  the  derived  left
derived  fun  of  the  thing  you  have  being
categories  uh  and  similarly  you  can  also
I  mean  the  drive  tender  produ  is  also
obtained  by
driving  the  thing  you  already
havean
level  but  here  how  do  you  know  that  the
solid  category  is  presentable  in
your  before  you  you  prove  the
existence
um  yeah  I  think  there  are  General  theor
that  if  you  just  ask  locality  for  such  a
map  there  are  some  automatic  presented
work
okay
so  uh  so  once  we  pass  to  the  dri  t  i  can
St  things  from  last  time  that  really  the
deriv  Sol  application  of  z  s  is  still
limit  as  Z
end  so  it  is  uh  the  other  solation  there
are  no  higher
homies  and  uh  so  also  the  Der
solidification  of  p  is  this
perect
and  the  Der  C  product  of  s  to  copy  is
the
under  okay  so  you  might  think
that  nothing  arried  it  really  ever
appears  in  practice  but  not  so  um  here's
the  very  F
proposition  uh  let's  say  again  that  uh
for  simp  the  xcw
complex
so  recall  that  in  this  situation  we
previously  had  this  thing  that  the  X
groups  against
the  they  are  the  singular
Gres
right
um  but  now  we  can  also  interpret  the
homology  of  X  and  it  turns  out
that  a  singular  homology  of
x  is  exactly  the
iology  of  the  the
solidification  more
precisely  um  I  mean  there's  some  of  to
complex  Computing  singular
modin  and  this  is  really  isomorphic
to  the
rication  in  particular  the  RO  ification
is
actually  comes  from  the  complex  of  the
street  being
groups
so  again  this  is  some  kind  of  version  of
the  if  you
take  this  three  group  on  X  and  this
models  so  as  example  like  if  you  take
the  three  intervals  is  some
large  thing  right  and  the  underlying
thing  is  finite  sums
of  points  but  if  you  solidify  them  the
interval  just  goes  away  it  just  becomes
Z  and  but  if  you  take  the  circle  and
solidify  that  that  becomes  a  copy  of  Z
degre  zero  and  a  copy  of  zg
one  and  in  general  if  you  take  uh
this  is  Union  of  circles  of  all
dimensions  and  you  get  something  which
is  concentrated  degree  zero  but
solidification  goes  arbitrarily  in  part
to  the
left
um  right  and
so  uh  again  there's  the  formal  reduction
to  the  case  of
complex  so  justs
assuming  I  keep
theor
which  um  and  so  for  financy  w
complex  uh  how  do  we  actually  comput
this  so  so  assume
comp  and  also  it's  to  fin  complex  we
know  this  homology  is
finite  generate  eache  okay
so  I  I  may  miss  the  point  but  you  said
that  the  direct  solidification  with  GX
under  bar  is  a  singular  uh  complex  right
so  it  is  a
Qing  it  is  one  so  in  above  this
statement  you  said  that  say  yeah  sorry
it's  just  a  qu  isomorphism  ah  qu
isomorphism  sorry  I  see  sorry  not  the
yeah  sorry  it's  only
find  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  that  do  makes
sense  sorry  sorry  sorry  I  see  I  see
sorry
um  okay  so  how  do  we  compute  the  the
appication  so  uh  so  we  do  the  use  those
things  so  we  take  some  subjection  from
some  life  profile  set  onto  X
so  like  the  cont
said  and
then  uh  we  get  all  fber  products  and
this  usess  resolution  of  this  condenser
being  here  by  the  guy  on  S  and
then  uh  the  guy  on  the  F
product  which  is  again  some  light
profess  and  then  and  all  the  fiber
products
okay  so  that's  the  resolution  of  of  this
guy  and  so  to  form  the  d  uh
solidification  we  can  somly  the  D
solidification  to  all  the  terms  here  but
for  these  terms  we  know  that  it's
concentrated  degree  zero  uh  so  we  know
that  the  derived
solidification  is
computed
by  uh  this
let  me  not
underline
okay  now  this  see  might  seem  a  bit  hard
to  compute  uh  but  we  know  that  each  term
here  is  actually  just  internal
home  from  the  continuous  functions  from
s  into  z  z
right  because  uh  that's  something  I
discussed  at  the  end  of  the  last  lecture
I  mean  this  formula  that  this  limit  of
the  SN  can  be  uh  translate  into  this
formula  so  these  are  some  kind  of
measures  on
X  and  similarly  for  the
other
so  this  actually  means  that  all  the
terms  all  the  terms  in  this  complex  are
isomorphic  to  their  double  dual  right  so
the  continuous  functions  from  s  to  Z  is
besides  the  Duel  of  sorry  the  Dual  of  of
this  one  and  then  I  dualize
again
uhor  that's  solidified  is  actually
just
home
and  I  I  could  also  put  put  the  r  here  it
doesn't  change  high  in  those  cases  um
and  so  this  actually  means  that  uh  the
same  formula  will  be  true  for  this  guy
if  you  think  about  it  so
because  resoltion  so  this  means  that
also  this  gra  solidification  here  one
way  to  compute  it  is  that  it  un
isomorphically  to  the  r
form  R
form
X
but  now  we're  in  business  because  we
know  that  this  guy  here  is
just  some  isomorphic  to  quic  to  singular
Co  chain
complex  and  uh  because  we  know  that  the
singular  chology  for  fin  CW  complex  is
fin  in  each  degree  uh  it's  some  taking
the  Dual  of  singular  corology  against
singular
homology
okay  and  so  you  get  the
qu  the  Der  solidification  of  X  and
singular
and  so  this  means  that  to  some  extent
this  passage  from  light  condens  being
groups  or  solid  being  groups  uh  is  like
passing  to  homotopy  types  A  little  bit
like  at  least  for  CW  complexes  it's  some
contracts  the  interval  and  then  some
identifies  two  homotopy  equivalen  W
complexes  but  on  like  totally
disconnected  things  it's  much  finer
information  or
it's  yeah  you  could  still  invert
homotopy  equivalence  but  not  invert  V
homotopy
equivalence  so  is  it  the  case  for
locally  contractable  spaces  in  the  sense
that  you  explained  yes  yes  so  whatever  I
said  about  CW  complex  also  works  for  a
locally  contractable  session  actually
uhan  pointed  out  to  me  that  uh  the  par
prce  assumptions  actually  not  required
in  comparing  singular  chology  and  chief
chology
no  no  they  are  not  required  there  are
some  recent  papers  Su  that  effect
um  but  I  don't  care  some  sense  right  now
so  right  uh
so  I  know  it's  fun  it's  probably  not
really  relevant  right  now  but  F  to  know
um  okay
so  now  let  me  go  back  and  try  to
describe  the  the  category  of  solid  a
little  better
um
and  um  so
yeah
so
uh  we  want  understand  the
structure  Al  Sol  being
better  so  so  there  is  a  comp  projective
generator  so  there's  definitely  a  notion
of  find  generated
objects
and  these  are  precisely  the
Cs  of  a
disas  and  then  there's  a  notion  of  fin
presented
object  uh  these  are
uh  the  coreel  of
map  and  it  turns  out  that  so  the  modules
behave  like  modules  in  the  following
sense
uh  that's  a  presented  objects  form
itself  in  a
category
and  like  the  only  critical  thing  is
stability  under  kernels  but  once  you  has
that  it's  automatically  stay  under
kernels  Co
kernel  and  really  really  only  the
kernel  are  something  to  mention
um  and  the  whole  category  is  just  the
end  category  of
those
also  any  finally  presented  object
actually  AIC  to  cor  of  injective
Meth
this  actually  something  slightly  better
than  what  DUS  announced  in  the  first
lecture
uh  he  claimed  that  the  science  presented
objects  has  a  resolution  of  length  two
and  uh  but  actually  length  one  is  good
enough
any
and  there's  a
resolution  just
stop
okay  so  there
some  the  finite  objects  in  your  C  which
are  exactly  the  of  injective  maps
and  then  everything  is  a
f
um  I  the  key  spe  for
this  is  the  following  that  uh  so  trying
to  understand  all  the  five  presentive
ones  then  okay  you  have  a  kernel  you  can
always  find  the  subjection  onto  M  and
then  there's  some  kernel  and  the  kernel
you  still  know  is  at  least  a  finally
generated  subm  module  of  this  and  so
then  it  would  be  good  to  know  that  all
the  fin  generated  sub  modules  of  this
are  actually  such  a  product  and  this  is
what  I  claim
now
zero  no  sorry
sorry  let's  say  product  of  copies  of
Z  generically  it  be  product  course  could
be  zero
fin
um  so  this  definitely  implies  this
statement  here  but  it  also  implies  like
okay  so  object  are  always  St  on  the  C
and  extensions  um  things  that  they're
stable  under
kernels
uh  but  then  I  mean  this  also  always  for
reduces  to  identifying  the  finally
generated  sub  modules  of  like  you're
generating  objects  and  if  those  are  all
finally  presented  then  then  you're  in
good  shape  and  this
some
so  the  Ser  is  really  easy  to  deduce
from  okay  so  let's  proof
Sy
so  we  know  that  uh  it's  finally
generated  so  we  know  that  there  is  some
subjective  map  from  product  of  copies  of
Z  onto  M  which  injects  back  into
of  by  the  way  uh  this  is  again  the
result
it's  previously  a  lot  of  what  I  was
talking  about  about  the  general
properties  of  the  car  Sol  being  groups
they  basically  extend  to  the  full
condensed  setting  not  just  the  line  one
this  Serum  is  again  one  which  only  holds
in  the  L
setting
um  and  be  because  we're  again  using  some
countability  in  just  a  second  um  okay  so
so  we  have  some  here  let's  go  g
um  and  we  know  that  the
uh  the  MS  from  a  product  back  to  Z  uh
they  are  given  by  direct  sum  so  we
actually  know  that  this  is  dual  to  a
m
uh  in  the  other  direction  from  a  direct
sum  of
these  and  basically  our  task  is  to  show
that  whenever  we  have  such  a  such  a
anamorphism  of  direct  sum  of  these  and
when  we  dualize  then  this  image  here  is
itself  a  prod
right
so  for  the  proof  I  will  use  the
following  fact  which  I'm  not  sure  if
it's
known  uh  that  well  known
uh  uh
let  N  accountable  grou
um  that  into
AAL  I  mean  it's  just  an  abstract  yeah
discret  no  condens  that  EDS
into
uh  Z
ISE  okay
maybe
um
uh  okay
um  let  me  leave  this  as  an  exercise
um  I  no  is  definitely  fult  if  you  drop
the  accountability  assumption  because  if
you  take  an  actra  prodct  of  copies  of  an
AB  being  group  it's  definitely  not  a
free  being
group  um  but  one  thing  this  implies  is
that  if  I  look  at  the  image  of
AG  uh  then  this  is  definitely  countable
and  it  embeds  in  the  direct  sum  do  also
into
D  implies  that  the  image  of
H
three  for  this  you  don't  need  this  it's
just
image  okay  I  will  use  a  spe  again  in  a
second  so  I  want  mention  it  way  to
justify  this  to  use  f  but  okay  may  it's
easier  uh  so  the  image  is  free  um  but
then  you  have  a  subjection  here  from
this  direct  sum  onto  another  free  group
so  this  splits  in  particular  like
there's  there's  a  kernel
here  but  this  must  actually  split  back
so  the  of
H  uh  split  as  a
summon  I  mean  maybe  actually  this
completely  irrelevant  maybe  I  should
focus  more  on  the  potion  but  let  me  just
try  to  understand  a  little  bit  about  the
structure  of  such  such  snaps  and  what  it
implies  on  the  Dual  side
um  uh  so  we  kind  of  split  but  this  means
that  uh  you  can  basically  replace  this
by  the  other  direct  factor  which  is  also
freeb
and  replace  H  by  the  corresponding  thing
because  then  this  corresponding  this
prodct  will  split  into  two  two  copies
and  this  n  will  just  embed  into  one  of
them  uh
so  we  can  definitely  assume  that  H  is
indexes  um  Okay  so  so  now  we  have  an
injection  I'm  going  direct  some  of
these  and  now  we  have  some  qution
here  and  now  the  next  thing  is  to
understand  structure  of  the
potion
you
um  so
uh  there  is  a  certain  quent  of  Q  which
is  the  image  when  you  embed  it  into
double  um
sorry  let  me  just  write  as  a  produ  over
all  over  these  over  all  possible  maps
from  two  into
V  so  you  can  look  at  all  possible  maps
that  Q  maps  to  a  fre  group  or  just  to  to
Z  and  takes  the  corresponding  maps  to  Z
and  then  there  will  be  some  quo  here  uh
and  then  by  the
fact  uh  this  guy  is  actually
free  okay  and  so  this  means  fre
or  particular  projector  splits  at  a
direct
summon  and
so  uh  and  also  if  you  look  at  the  teral
of  this  m  um  then  it's  easy  to  see  from
this  that  this  Q  Prime  will  have  no  more
maps  to  Z  right  because  if  this  had  a
map  to  Z  then  because  this  is  a  direct
sum  there's  another  map  from  q  q  to  Z
which  would  make
Q  okay  so  this  means  that
uh  this  has  this  potion  Q  Bar  which  is
free  and  so  this  splits  back  here  but
then  also  back  here  if  you  want  and  so
then  you  can  also  get  rid  of  that
Su
uh  okay  so  without  L  of
generality  so  you  can  replace  some  Q  by
Q  Prime  and  then  there  are  no  more  hph
to  Z  those
generality
um  Q  has  no  more  maps  to
Z  a  different  way  to  think  about  what
this  I'm  doing  here  is  to  observe  that
um  the  category  of  countably  Genera
three  being  groups  has  core  kernels  and
this  Q  Bar  would  be  the  core
kernel
okay
okay  so  where  are  we  in  the  proof  so
we're  trying
to  show  that  whenever  we  have  a  MTH  of
direct  sums  of  Z  then  once  we
dualize  the  image  of  this  map  is  itself
a  product  of  copies  of
Z  and  now  we  split  it  off  the  kernel  we
split  it  off  part  of  the  cor  kernel  and
now  we're  down  to  a  situation  where  we
have  this  map  and  Q  has  more  maps  to  Z
and  we're  trying  to  understand  what
happens  if  we
dualize  okay
so
um  so  we  have  here  product  of  copies  of
Z  cop  of
z  uh  this  map  here  is  our  old
map  d
and
uh  all  right  uh  sorry  theal  this  is
precisely
uh  the  internal
home  from  Q  to
Z  and  then  the  would  be  actually
X1
um
and  no
but  so  we  ensured  that  the  home  from  Q
to  Z  is  Zer  but  actually  it  turns  out
that  the  interal  home  from  Q  to  Z  is
zero
as  the
points
are  home  from
q  t  z  join  s  into  Z  which  by  using  T
Junction  this  different  order  is  the  hom
from  Q  into  the  continuous
MV  which  is  a  discrete  guy  and  where
this  guy  is  Sol
three  uh  and
so  uh  but  Q  has  no  maps  to  Z  and  just  no
map  any  being  group
and  okay  and
so  so  what  does  this  mean  so  this  means
that  the  image  of  G  is  actually  just
this  product  of  G's  so  some  the
reductions  we  made  in  the  beginning
precisely  ensured  that  actually  our  m  g
became  injected
just
and  okay  I  guess  strictly  speaking  I  did
some  of  these  reductions  it  could  have
happened  that  an  infinite  direct  sum
became  a  finite  direct  sum
but
just  take  the  direct  s  with  an  in  thing
whatever
um  uh
okay  so  that's
good
um
um  right  so  actually  call  a
proof  is  that
the
uh  any  M  which  is
a  p  presented  solid  gu
um  here's  a  direct  fun  or  a
product  copies  of
Z  and  the  group  of  the  form
X1  of  few  against  C  for  some  countable
being  group
q  without  naaps  to
Z
and  so  if  Q  is  actually  a  torsion  group
uh  that  these  are  precisely  is  a  profile
General  there  are  some  kind  of  weird  non
separated
guys  okay  uh
uh  ah  and  here's  another  fun
um  uh  so  this  this  call  is  again
something  that's  only  true  in
the  uh  in  the  live  setting  namely  that
the  product  of  copies  of  V  is  actually
flat  so  next  Che
it's  not  always  true  that  projective
objects  are  um  we  could  check  that  once
we  pass  the  P  numbers  um  something  like
this  holds  true  in  like  without  the  LI
assumption  but  we  were  kind  of  confused
about  the  case  of  solid  being  groups  and
then  but  then  Sim  observed  that  actually
it's  false  uh  in  all  solid  being  groups
the  flatness  but  once  you  restrict  to
the  light  connect  becomes  true
again  which  is  also  kind  of  the  reason
that  we  never  saw  any  obstruction  to
this  in  actual  mathematical  practice
um  and
why  uh  so  we
need  for  all  and
solid  The  Rock  Solid  and  the
productes
the  Sol  T  Ro
T  Co  limits  so
generality  to
prevented  uh  so  we  actually  have  a
resolution  of  length
one
uh  but  now  I  T  this  with  a  product  of
copies  of  Z  then  this  map  stays
injected  this
St  I  mean  it's
just  I  mean  actually
this  actually  what  you  really  see  is
that  if  you  take  the  d  uh  it's  called  T
this  the  prod  of  this  you  actually  just
get  a  product  of  c
of
for
because  so  you  can  just  write  this  as  a
fil  the  fin  presented  guys
and  all  right
uh
so  uh  and  one  thing  that's  really  nice
about  this  whole  tender  product  is  that
uh  really  gives  a  lot  of  I  mean  many
many  computations  come  out  right  um  in
sometimes  non  obvious  ways  just  like
maybe  previously  a  lot  of  EX
computations  came  out  right  now  obious
ways  and  so  maybe  uh  let  me  do  some
tensor
computations
um  so  often
uh  you  maybe  care  about  things
like  you  start  with
some  in  being
gr  and  a  speed  being
group  and  then  you  form  the  per
completion  of  them
and  and  then  in  this  for  in  this  such
situations  uh  one  often  users  with
complet  the  T  of
product  uh  which  is  like  completion  of
the
usual
if  you  do  some  kind  of  formal  geometry
or
something
um  and  here's  a  the  that  is  actually  uh
what  the  s  t  product  does  uh  so  actually
like  in  full  generality  for
any  being  group  is  actually  better  to
replace  this  by  soal  deriv  De  completion
which
is  the  deriv  PO  operation
um  very  where  this  deriv  thing  just
means  a  complex  represented  by
multiplication  by  where  this  sits  in
degree  zero  is  this  sits  in  homological
degree  minus  one  or  homological  degre
one
uh  almost  always  this  agrees  with  usual
comption  it's  degre  zero  but  in  complete
generality  that's  a  better  operation  um
and  so  generally  uh  and  then  it  makes
sense  to  talk  about  derive  I  mean  these
things  are  the  derive  complete  s
um  uh
and  uh  so  here's  here's  a
proposition
uh  and  because  we're  doing  the  is
slightly  better  to  from  the  start  uh
work  in  the  dra  category  and  let  me
assume  I  have  things  which  are  conc  non
negative  degrees  so  go  to  the
left  so  see  I  have  two  of
them  and  they  are
complete
so  there  isomorphic
to  D  of  the  D  production  from  P  to  the
n  n  obviously  it's  actually  also  a
condition  you  can  check  on
grps
uh
then  also  there  Sol
products
um  let  me  prove  this  in  a  second  let  me
just  Note  One  cor  which  is  for  example
that  if  you  take  a  I  don't  know  infin
direct  some  of  copies  of  Z  and  take  a
period  completion  of  that  and  then  take
product  of  that  with  such  a  period
completion
of  you  just  get  the
similar
so  this  means  that  in  such  kind  of
situations  of  more  or  less  formal
geometry
uh  d  i  complete  things  the  S  product
does  what  you  would  expect  it  to
do  and  there's  really  nothing  special
about  the  number  P  here  I  me  could  work
with  any  base  ring  and  solid  modules
structure  with  that  ring  and  then  any
element  of  that  ring
would  so  this  PRD  completion  of  the  free
free  ailan  group  you  consider  it  as  a  as
a  solid  as  a  light  condensability  group
or  as  a  is  it  is  it  solid  I  found  the
completion  in  condenser  being  groups  so
it's  it's  a  all  the  z  p  to  the  end  all
the
but  takes  a  limit  to  requires  the  non
condens
strategy  and  it  is  solid  the  it  is  solid
because  solid  I  mean  the  class  of  Sol  is
stable  under  all  limits  liit  and  so  on
so  start  with  C  which  is  solid  take  a
direct  Sol  take  to  end  it's  solid  take  a
limited  um  uh  remk
uh  there's  nothing  special  about
P  for  any
R
um  any  elements
or
and  and  and  then  which  are
solid  a  for  now  I  mean  this  at  this
moment  it  really  just  means  a  modules
inside  solid  B
groups  uh  which  are  the  T
complet
then  the  dve  10  the  product  of
M
is  I  should  mention  is  actually  a  COR
with  the  proceeding  so  we  know  there's
definitely  a  map  from  here  to  here
because  the  standard  product  represents
B  maps  and  so  there  is  obious  B  map  to
here
um  uh  but  both  sides  are  deriv  promete
the  right  hand  side  by  definition  the
left  hand  side  by  the  proposition  um  so
to  check  whether
we  can  actually  check  after  reduction  P
because  for  dve  complet  things  is  can  be
checked  modular  P  but  modular  P  both
sides  just  become  theet  and  you're  just
taking  the  usual  TCT  of  product  of  FPS
and  product  a  direct  sum  of  FPS  and  a
direct  sum  of  FPS  and
just
um  okay  so
uh  let  me  give  a  pro
sketch  uh  so  first  of  all  maybe  in  this
situation  you  can  actually  work  with  a
zp  instead  because  uh  the  D  centerct  of
zp  was  CP  uh  is  just
zp  um  that's
because  you  can  take  C  power  series
T  C
power  and  then  you  fren  by  T  minus  p  and
uus  p  um  then  tus  P  you  get  here  uus  P
get  here  but  also  when  you  take  this
power  Series  in  two  variables  and  but
tal  to  P  I  mean  then  you  get  zp  power
but  thenal  to  zp  um  so  this  actually
means
that  uh  the  drive  ceg  of  solid  zp
modules  is  automatically  full  sub  of
solid  Z
module  so  being  a  ZT  module  is  not  a
structure  and  a  solid  being  it's  just  a
condition  and  if  everything's  complete
then
uh  uh  everything  becomes  a  zp  module  so
so  m\&n  is  actually  here
and  everything  is  taking  place  in  the
subcategory  okay  and  let's  actually  let
me  do  the  case
where  which  is  maybe  the  most
destructive  case  uh  where  m  is  really
just  uh  take  a  direct  sum  of  copies  of
zp  uh  but  you  complete  a  direct  sum  and
then
small
then  in  order  to  compute  what  the  Sol  T
product  does  we  have  to  write  this  in
terms  of  our  generating  objects  and  this
is  actually  a  slightly  non  trial
exercise  because  there  is  actually
rather  large  to  liit  of  compx  detective
objects  um  so  what  What's  Happening  Here
is  that  this  actually  is  a  CO
limit  overall
functions  from  n  to  n  uh  which  go  to
Infinity
so  they  only  find  the  many  values  where
below  some
constant
um  all  the  FR  of  copies  Over  N  of  to  F
of  so  what's  happening  here  so  first  of
all  why  is  there  a
map  so  whenever  you  have  a  map  which
goes  to  Infinity  you  can  take  the
product  of  these  copies  of  P  to  the  F
and  DP  and  this  actually  match  to  the
completed  direct
sum  because  modu  each  power  of  P  almost
all  of  the  terms  in  this  product  will  go
to
zero  that's  because  this  is  going  to
Infinity
um
but
uh  uh  and  quite  obviously  also  an
injector  um  but  then  you  still  have  to
show  that  it's  a  surge  action  so  you
have  to  show  that  whenever  a  live  Prof
set  map  is  completed  direct  sum  it
actually  effected  over  one  of  these
terms  but  if  you  have  a  map  into  this
uh
completion  then  yeah
Fe
Vector  think
any  light
from  and  the  map  from  s
this
um  I'm  just  thinking  whether  in  the  most
General  case  I'm  actually
um  uh  so  pick  any  sest  and  the  map  from
to  copies  of
D  which  is  by  the  permission
liit  and
so
so  we  have  I  don't  know  G  here  and  so  we
have  a  collection  of  M  GN  here  and  then
G  each
GN  vors
over  some  direct  sum
over
uh
integers  at  most  some
uh  a
of  um
right  because  uh  this  is  a  like  I  mean  a
compact  object  and  Maps  lot  so  it
must  what  is
this
and
uh
so  okay  so  let  me  go  right  so  so
there  are  just  a  few  bunch  of  elements
where  you  you  get  something  mod  P  one
and  then  there  is  maybe  a  larger  Bunch
where  you  get  something  non  zero  uh  mod
P  P  squ  and  then  there's  something  even
larger  where  you  get  something  non  zero
mod  cubed  but  then  you  can  just  find
some
slowly  very  slowly  increasing  function  f
uh  uh  sub  effect  over  this  product
right  so  what's  what's  my  diagram  here
uh  these  are  my  M  these  are  my  M  and
okay  this  is  AF  one  this  is
AF
okay
so  so  this  means  that  this  tend  of  M  and
M  um  each  of  those  so  it's
a  of  f  of  of  to  the  F  of
n
p  and  then  I  take  Sol  product
with  a  similar  expression  on  the  other
side  and  let  me  call  now  this  function
for  the  other  Factor  T  and  let  me  call  a
variable  on  the  other  side
n
zp  and  the  S  TCT  canes  Coit  so  I  can
pull  the  Coit  out  so  it's  a  CO
liit  over  two
functions  from  n  to  n  which  goes  both  to
infinity  and  uh  and  then  the  individual
hand  up  these  I  mean  both  of  these  are
just  products  of  zps  uh
and  yeah  I
mean  I  probably  didn't  say  it  so  far  but
product  of  CPS  they  just  become  the  B
INF  product  again  just  for  like  for
product  of  c
um  and  so  now  it's  the  product  of  N  and
m  in  M  of  P  to  the  F  of  n  plus  P  of
m
c
and  now  this  has  an  obvious  map  so  f  on
it  over  all  functions  let  me  call  them  H
which  are  now  functions
on  both  coordinates  which  just  go  to
Infinity
on  yeah  is  a  function  of  two  variables
uh  and  then  you  put  the  function  of  H
and  N  here  uh  where  this  this  is  uh
completed
and  now  at  first  you  might  think  that
this  will  surely  not  work  out  because
here  you're  allowed  to  quantify  over  all
arbitrary  slowly  increasing  functions  of
two  variables  whereas  here  you're  just
getting  those  that  are  sums  of  functions
of  one  variable
individually  but  then  there's  just  maybe
at  first  slightly  surprising  but  not  Al
how  to  prove  combinatorial  L  that
whenever  you  have  such  a  slowly
increasing  function  H  you  can  always
find  one  that's  even  slower  increasing
uh  which  is  a  sum  of  two  functions  of
individual
coordinates  leave  it  to  as  an  exercise
to  figure  that
out  but  that's  what  I  mean  that  the  Sol
T  Pro  like  for  non  obvious  reasons  giv
you  the  correct
awesome
um  and  so  yeah  General  argument  some
saying  so  you  can  redu  the  case  at  n  and
M  are  just
some
uh  yeah  completed  direct  sums  of  copies
of  the  generators  and
then  all  as  the  same  argument  you
actually  have  to  be  slightly  careful
because  upor  you  can  also  have  the  case
that  M  and  M  are  completions
of  uh  a  direct  sum  which  is  over  an
uncountable  index  set  and  then  you  still
want  that  uh  but  then  there's  actually
an  argument
that  the  uncountable  case  just  by  more
formal  aru  to  cont
Cas  because  this  der  completions  they
always  commute  with  I  mean  you  can
always  ruce  uncountable  things  to
contable  things
because
just  anys
um  right  so  this  is  a  nice  computation
um  there  are  some
even  there  are  some  further  computation
that  come  out  right  uh  which  some  really
appear  when  you  do  someone  solid
functional  solid  functional
now  so  let  me  work  over
QP  for
Simplicity  uh  but  most  one  of  what  I'm
saying  uh  works  over
any
me
so  then  again  uh  solid  PP  displaces  or
even  the  D
category  it's  just  the  full  subcategory
well  P  modules  and  those  where  p  is
invertible  and  it's  the  full  subeg  of  be
group  and  if  you  form  10  prodcts  and
just  some  St  was  in  the
sub
um
and  uh  this  category  itself  it  now  has  a
compact  projective
generator  well  here  will  be  a  product  of
zps  and  here  you  have  to  invert  p  take
of
zp  this  is  a  slightly  curious  kind  of
topological  Vector  space  or  like  condens
vector  space  but  actually  comes  from  a
topological  Vector  space  so  it's  it
looks  like  one  where  some  the  unit  which
would  have  a  norm  where  the  unit  ball  is
this  thing  where  the  unit  ball  is
compact  but  actually  there's  is  General
thing  you  cannot  have  bner  spaces  or
Norm  Vector  spaces  of  infinite  Dimension
ver  unit  ball  is  compact  so  it  actually
turns  out  that  if  you  were  trying  to
endulge  this  with  a  norm  in  the  kind  of
obvious  way  where  this  would  becomes  the
unit  ball  then  the  nor  map  would  not  be
a  continuous  map
and  so
this  yeah  it's  not  really  a  norm  Vector
space  is  what  it  is
uh  so  uh  these  things  have  appeared  a
little  bit  also  in  the  classical
function  literature  uh  May
firstan
called  um
uh  I  mean  the  the  more  usual  objects  the
consider  thetic  function
analysis  which  space  you  wrote
Smith  theic  Smith
space  and  she  was  uh  studying  the  analog
of  those  things  over  the  real
numbers  they  can  also  consider  some  type
of  topological  Vector  spaces  where  which
as  well  ining  Union  uh  gotten  by  scaling
out  some  compact  convex
set  the  more  usual  objects  we  consider  B
spaces  and  at  least  separable  examples
of  those  exactly  the  on  that  we
considered  previously  you  take  it
accountable  copies  of  P  complete  and
then
and  there  certainly  also  in  this
category  and  we  just  saw  how  we  would
present  in  terms  of  the
generation
just
in
and  these  things  are  actually  in
reality
uh  Mi
places
SP  so  either  you  put  separable  and  light
on  those  sides  or
you  so  separable  on  the  bio  side  means
you  can  take  accountable  D  somewh  and
light  some  on  the  other  take  accountable
product  and  this  is  just  the  obvious
where  Take  A  Smith  space
St  but  you  can  also  take  B  of  space
like  so  yeah  so  the  generator  that  we
use  here  the  sp  there  and  sometimes  du
of  spaces  okay  we're  basing  everything
on
them
uh  uh  here's  again  a  curious  remark
um  and  maybe  people  ask  me  this  so  it
seems  relevant  uh  so  what  happens  if  you
try  to  do  the  sage  well  this  is  the  smth
this  projective  and  even  turn  projective
so  there  actually  deriv  so  um
uh
um  so  if  it  takes  the  r  home  here  it  is
just  the
internal
Zer  that's  true  and  kind  of  obvious  um
but  if  he  go  the  other  way  you  can  all
wonder  if  you  take  a  b  space  and  takes
the  drive  to  of  that  one
is  it  just  the  usual
dual  and  the  answer  is  uh  depends  on
your  model  of  the  set
the  in  the  same  way  as  this  came  up
before  so  again  it  fails  under  the
contines  but  under  this  principle  star
that  I  mentioned  that  is
consistent  uh  it's
because  a  BOS  space  is  a  special  type  of
Pro
Group  limit  of  direct  sums  over  end  of
QP  mode  p  toz
mzp  and  so  this  AR  de  like  between  Pro
things  and  this  precisely  the  thing
that's
controlled  this  is
princi
Yeah  the  more  I  think  about  the  more  I'm
actually  temped  to  just
uses  work  model  is  true  uh  because  you
have  the  choice  of  either  these  higher  X
being  some  junk  that  really  has  no
meaning  at  all  all  them  being
zero
um  okay
um  but  other  like  what  I  DUS  and  I  have
been  trying  to  do  this  this  question  was
never  really  relevant  so  that's
sometimes  you  run  into  this  thing  I  mean
it's  definitely  like  if  you  do  some  kind
of  computations  now  with  in  this  kind  of
solid  function  analysis  you're  doing
lots  of  home  lots  lots  of  tenses  lots  of
homes  and  so  on  at  some  point  surely  you
will  at  some  point  take  some  our  home  of
b  space  against  D  somewhere  and  then  you
can  decide  whether  you  work  in  a  model
where  it's  just  some  joint  or  you  work
in  this  model  where  it's  what  it's
supposed  to  be
so  um  but  what  I  really  wanted  to  say  is
uh  so  you  know  you  also  have  to  fre
spaces  um  which  are  uh  countable  limits
of  FAL  spaces  along
them
these  are  really  uh  this  really  pop  up  a
lot
um  and  there  is  a  notion  of  uh  there's  a
standard  notion  of  computer  trans  for
them  uh  in  particular  it's  the  one
that's  compatible  with
limits
so  on  B  bases  it's  a  usual  BF  tender
product  and  when  you  have  f  space  inv
such  a  accountable  limit  and  it's  the
other  one  also  in  some  corresponding
limit  of  complete  T  of  products  of  B
spes  and  so  like  a  general  thing  that
usually  when  you  define  such  T  prods  and
function  analysis  is  that  you're  trying
to  make  some  compatible  with  limits  here
right  for  example  in  this  case
uh  which  is  not  readed  because  our  Sol  T
produ  was  defined  to  be  compatible  with
Co
limits  and  usually  there  are  very  few
funs  that  are  compatible  with  limits  and
to  limits  and  certainly  thect  is  not
compatible  with  all  limits  uh  but
fortunately  it  so  turns  out  that  in  this
situation  it  does  give  the  correct
answer  so  here's  a
proposition  if
CMW  this
let  say  considered  as  topologic  spes  for
the
moment
uh  then  you  can  pass  the  condensed  World
from  line  and  then  take  the  Sol  tender
product  or  even  the  dve  Sol  tender
product  and  it  turns  out  that  this  is
really  just
uh  the  completed  T  PR  spaces  and  then
pass  in  particular  it's  deg
Z  for  example  if  you  take  a  product  of
copies  of
p  and  take  another  prod  of
P  it  becomes  the  by
infinite  which  might  seem  like  it's  a
standard  thing  on  compact  projective
generators  but  it's  absolutely  not
because  these  things  are  very  very  far
from  being  compact  projective  only  these
kind  of  unit  balls  there  there  as
compact  projector  cars  but  this  is  a
huge
space
okay  and  so  let  me  again  just  give  an
proof  on  an  example
in
zamp  I  me  the  general  proof  is  in  some
sense  combining  uh  the  proof  I  did  there
with  those  poit  with  the  one  I  will  do
here  uh  and  we  kind  of  spray  by  was
doing  a  minimalistic  approach  to
combining  this  but  Sasha  e  actually  has
a  very  fancy  way  to  combine  them  that  he
needed  in  some  of  categorical  stuff  um
okay  so  so  so  okay
so  how  do  we  write  this  product  of  tpce
so  it's  again  such  a  huge  po
limit  and  this
time  you're  taking  such  a  unit  balls  but
uh  where  you  makes  the  denominators
larger  and  larger  so  you  take  of  P  the
minus  FN  *
DC
um  where  again  f  is  some  function  from  n
to  n
but  now  we're  taking  forward  over  ever
faster  increasing  functions  so  it's
certainly  going  to  Infinity  but  but  very
fast
say
um  right  because  again  if  you  have  any
complex  project  I  mean  any  profile  that
mapping  into  here  in  each  factor  it  will
Factor  over  some  uh  over  some  pie  of  F
mCP  and  then  you  just  well  take  this
function  and  I  mean  generically  it's
probably  a  function  that  I  don't  know
just  for  any  n  you  give  some  value  but
for  each  new  number  you  can  make  it  much
much
larger  okay  so  uh  and  so  if  you  take
this  tend
product  it's  a
Col  by  same  Principle  as  before  now  we
have  two
functions  which  go  to  Infinity  very  fast
um  of  a
product  n  n  of
tus  FN
minus
zp  and  again  this  next  to  a  similar
col  or  functions  which  are  functions  of
both
uh  variables  going  to  Infinity  very  fast
um
and  again  you  might  naively  think  that
surely  if  I  have  two  variables  I  can
build  functions  that  are  so  fast
increasing  that  I  can  never  dominate
them  by  something  that's  uh  some  of
functions  in  both  variables  but
turns  out  again  by  basically  the  same
argument  as  there
is  you  can  always  dominate  any  such
function  by
function  all  right  that's  fun
um  all  right
uh
I  should  maybe  say  I  mean
uh  this  is  some  f  poet  here  but  the
precise  structure  of  this  Index  postet
this  is  actually  where  all  the  set
appears  so  here  we  kind  of  don't
actually  have  to  understand  what  this
looks  like  because  this  combinator  can
just
prove  but  for  these  X  computations  you
really  have  to  he  some  starting  with
such  a  description  in  the  case  of  b
space  and  then  do  that  and  so  then  this
this  this  huge  call  liit  becomes  a  huge
derived  limit  and  then  you  really  have
to  Grapple  with  a  structure  of  this  kind
of  postet
of  functions  that  grow  arbitr  fast  and
uh  this  is  something  that  very  much
depends  on  your  model  of  set  here
particular  on  the  cardinality  of  SP  set
just
a
all  right
um
yeah  I  think  that's  basically  all  I
really  wanted  to  say  but  if  there  have
questions  we  have  a  few
minutes  so  for  functional  analysis  in
some  very  large  B  of  spaces  does  it  make
a  difference  if  you  work  in  light
condenser  or  all  condensed  sets  it
doesn't  make  a  difference  because  all  B
spaces  are  lied  all  for  spaces  are  lied
no  matter  whether  they're  separable  or
not  it's  just  the  pred  to  Smith  bases
only
they  uh  they
see  okay  it's  clear
Factor  yeah  because  it's  actually  have
some  kind  of  uncom  dimensional  V  Space
it's  still  the  filtered  just  naive
filtered  col  of
okay
okay  any  other
questions  is  the  sorry  it's  a  very  V
question  but  is  the  relation  between  the
homology  of  the  C  complex  and
ification  kind  of  the  accident  or  should
should  I  take  it  some
deep  I  mean  can  I  can
I  can  I  expect  that  we  will  have  another
example  in  I  don't  know  in  a  condensed
Spectra  or  something  like  that  for  other
well  instead  of  uh  like  taking  the  dra  C
being  groups  you  could  everywhere  work  a
category  of  Spectra  and  then  you  could
also  yeah  I  mean  maybe  a  good  point  to
point  out  the  following
um  there's  Spectrum  call  little
K  like  to  think  of  as  some  you  take  the
algebraic  Cas  of  the  complex  numbers  but
you  take  into  account  the  topology  that
the  glnc  has
right  um  uh  and  some
makes  this  homotopy  say  uh  and
classically  this  a  little  bit  hard  to
phrase  what  this  is  supposed  to  mean  I
believe  orbe  there  way  to  do  anyway  so
one  way  you  can  however  do  it  in  our
formalism  is  you  can  take  the  cas  of  the
complex  numbers  as  a  condensed  spectrum
because  I  mean  the  complex
numbers  this  is  a  condensed
ring  and  so  this  actually  means  that  F
Cas  series  is  kind  of  has  some  automatic
structure  as  condensed
Spectrum  right  because  to  give  a
condensed  Spectrum  I  have  to  give  a
function  for  each  maybe  live  profile  set
I  have  to  produce  a  spectrum  but  uh  I
can  just  take  the  case  theory  of  the
continuous  function  from  s  to
C  um  so  this  this  is  sorry  so  far  this
is  not  at  all  true  um  because  here  the
pi1  for  example  will  be  C  Star  as  a  as  a
condensed  being
group  but  uh  now  you  can  take
KFC  and
solidify  like  just  like  we  had  solid
draft  of  solid  being  groups  and  draft
car  of  condensed  being  groups  you  also
have  solid  Spectra  inside  of  all
condensed
Spectra  and  this  sonification  does
exactly  what  you  wanted  to  do  it  somehow
contracts  all  the  deal  NC  that  this  was
build  out  of  Toopy  Ty  essentially  by  the
proposition  I  mentioned  in  lecture  today
and  then  you  see  that  this  is  actually
exactly
the  and  I  mean  you  could  do  the  same
thing  really  not  just  for  the  complex
numbers  but  for  any  algebra  over  the
complex  numbers  or  even  a  category  over
the  complex  numbers  and  then  take  the
case  as  a  condensed  spectum  and  solidify
and  this  actually  gives  a  construction
of  what's  known  as  a  semitopological
case
mhm  so  it  is  solidification  of  what  semi
topological  uh
so  if  a  is  any  kind  of  C
algebra  was  it  SC  topology  or
uh  with  a  topology  I  don't  care
um  then  you  can  similarly  take  the  cas
of  a
and
solidify  and  this  recover  something
that's  known  as  a  sar  topological  case
the  I  some  some  some  hope  in  the  area
that  when  you  have  a  proper  smooth  DG
category  of  the  complex  numbers  there's
some  way  to  define  its  topological  case
Theory  and  I  think  this  was  one  of  the
reasons  people  started  uh  defining  the
same  toy  Cas  Theory  so  the  actual  one
should  be  a  module  over  periodic  KU  but
you  can  just  take  this  one  and  just
inverts  the  B  element  then  you  have  a
candidate  for  something  that  might  be
the  correct  thing  but  nobody  knows  how
to  prove  much  about  it  I
think  can  you  get  the  similar  result  for
KO  or  KR
sure  uh  just  write
R  yeah  I
mean  uh  I  mean  all  the  obvious  VAR  yeah
so  in  particular  KO  is  take  Cas  of  the
real
numbers  and  there's  something  I  know  PSP
or  whatever  it  is  and  then  maybe  related
to
the  so  here  the  K  is  the  periodic  or  the
the  full  spectr  I  mean  in  those  notation
I  the  algebra  Cas  Spectrum  uh  it  turns
out  to  be  connective  for  the  inputs  that
I'm  using  uh  maybe  not  quite  obviously
so  but  it's  true  um  and  so  there  is  a
connective
KU  uh  it  is  much  more  subtle  to  recover
the  periodic  you  I  mean  you  can  of
course  just  invert  what  El  at  the  end
but
uh  and  sometimes  some  this  antic  case
the  that  do  an  I  develop  which  is  a
different  way  to  approach  this  kind  of
stuff  is  aimed  at  defining  some  kind  of
version  of  the  cas  the  of  the  complex
numbers  but  now  analytic  ring  where  the
answer  well  certainly  has  a  St  negative
degrees
Ian  some  FS  is  it  somehow  related  to  the
description  of  the  small  KU  or  small  K
or  as  some  configuration  space  like
description  given  by  gam
seal  um  I  don't  know  about  the  ah
sorry  there's  some  uh  do  like
description  for  uh  small  K  and  for  using
a  like
vector  given  by
SE
uh  I  I  think  this  statement  is  much  more
naive  I  mean  this  is  really  just  this
statement  is  really  just  one  way  of
encoding  the  intuition  that  or  maybe  see
but  I  you  you  you  some  in  some  sens  this
is  false  some  something  that's  true
before  group  completion  namely  that  if
you  take
uh  the  infinity  monoid  classifying  space
of  c  and  then  pass  to  homotopic  types
here
um
then  then  I  mean  KU  is  a  good  completion
of  that  and  basically
solidification  uh  factors  over  passing
to  homotopy  types  and  so  this  is  seconds
um  but  they  have  I  don't  think  there  are
any  figuration
spaces  any  other
questions  to  what  extent  does  the  Sol
tens  product  combine  two  topologies  so
say  we  have  m  and  n  and  m  x  complete  and
directly  and  there  was  a  thing  that  I
mentioned  that  if  you  take  power  series
T  and  then  U  then  it  becomes  the  UT  edic
one  so  there  it  does  do  this  thing
um  and  this  more  b  space  setting  it
doesn't  do  it
I  so  when  you  TOR  over  a  and  you  have
this  exotically  complete  statement
now  when  you  can  take  the  completion  of
the  Ring  a  but  this  one  is  no
longer  the  derived  completion  does  it
make  a  difference  for  the
proof
uh  yeah  so  sorry  I  actually  realized
that
probably  most  General  version  for  St
might  not  be  expected  true
um  I  was  getting  confused  about  this
um  well  I  mean  if  you  want  to  compute
some
direct  product  of
a  solid  or  whatever
um
one  it's  kind  of  resolved  by  the  the
absolute  one  and
then  you're  also  taking  a  proct
a  and  so  to  show  that  this  here  is  the
completed  it's  enough  to  know  that  all
the  other  ones  are  and  this  way  you  can
kind  of  reduce  the  case  that  the  ring  a
is  actually  just
z  z  x
here  so  then  the  DED  X  completeness  of
this  one  reduces  to  the  one  here  here
here  but  a  itself  is  derived  X  complete
I  mean  if  it's  basically  X  complete  it's
also  derived  X  complete  um  so
uh  you  can  kind  of  reduce  this  statement
to  the  case  that  the  ring  is  really  just
the  join
x  what  did  you  mean  by  passing  to  otop
type  in  BGN  C  so
glnc  is  viewed  as  a  topological  space
and  therefore  as  a  as  a  condensed  set  or
or  notari  I  mean  yes  so  when  I  when  I
Define  KFC  one  way  to  do  that  is  to  take
this  classifying  space  of  DG  onc  and
then  I  have
some  uh  infinity  group  in  condensed
groupoids  um  and  then  I  group
completed  but
then
uh  yeah  so  some  physically  I'm  here
using  the  category  of  condens
Alima  which  contains  condensed  sex  or
condensed  groups  and  so  on  as  one  for
sub
category  but  contains  Ana  or  typ
whatever  there  another  for  sub  which  are
some  of  the  discret
objects  um
and  then  on  a  certain  class  of  objects
here  there's  a  left  joint  which  is
passing  to  the  homotopic  type  uh  and
this  is  not  always  defined  but  on  some
object  it's  defined  and  for  example  on
CW  complexes  it  is  defined  during
testifying  space  of  Jo  and  so  and  so
what  I  meant  there  was  that  I  kind  of
appli  this  left
joint
all  right  let's  stop
here

e
good
morning  um  so  today  I  want  to  talk  about
yeah  what's  called  analytic  at
spes
um  right  uh  so  but  I  want  to  immediately
point  out  that  there  is  some  conflict  of
mutation  here  or  conflict  of
terminal
um  so  basically  using  what  we've  said  so
far  all  EIC
spaces  give  rise  to  analytics  spes  in
our
sense  of  s  whatever  they  will
be  in  our
sense  uh  but  within  the  world  of  Ed
spases  there  was  already  qualifier
called  analytic
um  but  within  the  Ser  of  any
space  what  is
this  conflict  of  terminology
oh
um
uh  and  I  didn't  come  up  with  a  good  name
for  them  and  but  there's  one  name  that's
already  to  some  extent  used  in  this
world  of  tic  stat  also  uh  so  I  will  call
them  T  in  this
lecture  um  Peter  would  help  us  um  if  you
could  write  a  bit  bigger  because  uh  it's
it's  a  it's  just  a  bit
unclear  there  is  a  sh  or
something  okay  uh
yeah  uh  so
uh  yeah  just  that  I  don't  want  to
overuse  the  word  an  take  in
this  um
okay  so  here's  the  definition  where  this
already  used  this
name  uh  so  ubering
a  it's  called
f  so  this  is  terminology  that's  already
in  use
um  if  it  has  a  topologically  unit
s  saying  it's  also  called  theed
un
uh
right  so  so  so  the  example  to  keep  in
mind  is  for  example  TP  where  p  is  a
topologic
unit  or  in  fact  any  nonan  local
Feld  complete  of  course  we  always  assing
complet  or
any  kind  of  f  over  or  Anyan  any  u
r
over  because  when  you  have  a  topy  can
put  unit  in  summ  then  for  anything  above
you
also  and  let  me  call  space
state
so  that's  usually
called
analytic  if  it  is  covered  so  we  didn't
really  discuss  the  full  definition  of
edic  spaces  but  we  discussed  the  algebra
that  the  r  for  them  and  then  there's
some  way  of  doing  them  which  will  not  be
all  that  import  for  us  right  now  um  and
basically  we  told  you  what  the  open  Subs
are  then  you  kind  of  do  the  obvious
thing
um  it's  covered  by  such  uh  A+
uh  it's  actually  equivalent  to  a  point
condition  that  uh  here  I  speak  in  the
the  green  I  speak  green  speak  so  just  to
clarify  the  first
you  did  not  Define  analytic  spaces  in
our  sense  because  you  you
not  yeah  okay  and  also  adct  spaces  there
is  there  was  classically  there  is  a
subtlety  about  shiness  so  there  is  this
condition  in  Uber  that  and  then  it  seems
it  if  I  say  at  space  right  now  I
probably  mean  shiy  okay  yeah  but  then
there  is  also  the  question  of  whether  in
this  theory  of  localization  and  Dustin
talked  about  last  time  when  you  do  this
you  get  some  condensed  thing
possibly  you  get  some  condensed  thing
for  an  aoid  for  a  rational  domain  and  it
is
over  you
say  you  come  to  this  I  will  come  to  it
okay  okay  okay  so  you  need  some  in  all
cases  of  Interest  I  mean  usually  it
gives  the  right  thing  but  it's  I  don't
know  if  for  any  shy  think  it  get  I'm  not
sure  offer  I  will  come
to
um  um  so  if  you  have  any  space  you  can
actually  each  pointex  you  can  Define
soal  completed  res  field  and  this  can
either  be  just  the  screen  Rings  or  can
be  complete  on  median  fields  and  here
some  asking  that  there  are  no  points
where  this  is  a
discre
not
um  okay  and  so  then  yeah  basically  the
series  set  up  so  that  you  always  the  reg
fields  are  always  of  either  of  these
forms  but  then  when  you  have  such  a
complete  nonan  field  and  there  is  some
unit  in  there  and  you  can  lift  this  to  a
small  neighborhood  and  that's  why
there
um  and
so  uh  the
intuition
is  that  there  are  some  there's  a  world
of  schemes  this  sits  on  some  world  of
formal
schemes  maybe  with  some  adjectives  that
I  don't  want  to  discuss  right  now
because  it's  not  really  relevant  um
these  all  set  with  u  Ser  of  static
spaces  uh  but  then  these  are  some  of
things  that  where  you  start  with  the
scheme  and  there  is  some  still  some  kind
of  large  space  where  it  seem  like  or
least  like  underlying  reduced  but  then
these  anic  space  areas  are  some  of  the
ones  more  speaking  where  start  with  a
formal  scheme  but  then  remove  all  the
scheme  like  points
so  spaces  which  are  at  the  other
end
okay  and  so  I  mean  here  you  might  have
something
like  which  you  can  also  consider  some
kind  of  SP  TVP
that  um  but
then  um  the  generic  fi
such
sense  okay  um  let  me  say  few  words  about
structure  of  such
boings
so  let's  say
uh  so  we  always  have  this  range  of
definitions  so  okay  so  let's  say  Pi  in  a
such  a  topologic  unit
so  um  then  you  can  take  out  the  Ring  of
definition
and  because  and  you  can  always  assume
that  they  contain  any  given  power  bonded
element  and  I  mean  some  particular  power
bound  it  so  you  can  result  of  assume
that  your  um  definition  contains
P  you  could  also  do  it  such  way  to  take
any  and  then  some  power  of  P  will  anyway
SP  in  there  any  power  of  P  still  unit
and  then  actually  it's  automatically  the
case  that  a  Zer  car  P
toy
that's  an  actual  exercise  and  looking  at
the  aums
of  the  topology  onur  so  up  you  might
think  that  it  could  have  some  rather
more  subtle  uh  iology  for  generator  I
but  actually  it's  always  supp  um  and
then  you  can
actually
uh  into
a
with  Beau
all  a
z  for  example  you  could  say  that  the  the
norm  of  a  function
f
is  2  to  Theus
n  n  is
a  maximum  all  integers  m
such
that  techic  the  premum  because  it  could
also  be  in
um  uh  and  some  particular  this  means
that  the  norm  of  five  if  I  said  it  as
right  p  is
minus  the  nor  of  Pi  a  half  the  normal  by
inverse  and  of  course  there's  some  kind
of  arbitrary  choice  that  I  made  here
both  first  of  s  uniformize  p  and  in  like
the  number  a  half  here
um  the  trivial  counter  example  with  the
zero  ring  so  the  norm  of  Pi  would  be
zero  I  think  there  um
is  a
zero  I  don't  think  it  has  a  top  unit
right  or  I
mean
maybe  that's  a  counter  examp  to  make
think  that  anything  that  is  an  algebra
over  no  but  zero
be
Z  probably  okay  so
whatever  you  figure  it  out
what
um
uh  and  so
um  because  actually  Le  an
equivalence  between
faceing
and  alge  B  of  rings
um
admitting  and  may
should  first  of  all  much  the  objects  are
the  objects  are  B  Rings
admitting  some  B  rings
admitting  some  p
v  such  that  the  norm  of  Pi  is  basally
between  Z  and  one  and  nor  nor  inverse
equal  to
one  but  as  a  moment  you  you  actually
only  care  about  the  topology  used  by  the
by  the  mon  so
and  again  before  somebody  complains
everything  here  is
completed  um
B  ring  and
continuous  so  you  mean  ultrametric  ban
Rings  otherwise  you  have
a  and  of  course  the  zero  is  still  an
counter  example  to  what  happens  to  zero
uh
um
um  right
um  okay  so  so  these  are  uh  like  who
basic
algebras  that  we  consider  here  um  so  you
could  also  talk  about  this  in  the
language  of  B  algebras  but  you  shouldn't
really  fix  the  norm  but  you  should  just
ask  def  find  by  some  Norm  this  this
property  because  we
have
um  all  right  so  then  let  me
already  uh  come
to  right  so
so  now  I  want  to  State  a  Ser  that  K  and
proved
um  when  some  10  years  ago  or  so  and  the
serum  that  I  found  uh  extremely  striking
and  surprising  at  the  time  so  as  as  was
discussed  there  are  all  these  issues
that  for  General  Huber  ring  or  Huber
pair
uh  what  Huber  defines  is  not  always  uh
actually  a  she  so  um  so  but  let's  just
say  that
A+  is
GC  um  if  uh  what  hu
defines  U  defines  a  PR  she  of  hu
Rings  if  this  is  a
sheet  yeah  some  kind  of  stupid
definition
um  and  I  did  not  I  mean  I  did  certainly
expect  that  in  those  cases  where  you  can
prove  that  something  is  chy  you  can
probably  also  prove  other  nice
properties  because  then  that's  probably
reason  that  things  are  well  behave  what
I  did  not  at  all  uh  expect  is  that  you
could  prove  any  nonf  serum  whose  only
hypotheses  is  something  is  chy  and  then
other  good  things  happen  because  some
only  asking  for  the  like  there  the  first
thing  that  could  break  that  this  is  not
a  she  but  they  expect  that  if  you're  in
a  situation  where  I  mean  there  might  be
situations  that  just  for  stupid  is  a  she
and  then  why  why  should  other  okay  uh
but  here  Pro  the  following  St
z
uh  so  seee  a  is
f  and
a
so
uh
then  I  mean  any  final  protective
module  over
a  um  you  can  take  it  and  tender  over
sorry  M  uh
tender  it  was  over
a
she  and  I  mean  a  is  just  a  direct
module  so  certainly  this  is  still  a
sheath  that's  good  so  it's  a  sheath  of
finite  projective  modules  um  actually
it's  one  that's  locally  free  so  this  is
a  locally
free  f
bra  and  so  whenever  you  have
uh  uh  ring  space  you  can  always  talk
about  these  modules  which  are  locally
free  or  fin
rank  so  these  are  I  guess  called  us
called  vect
B  with  respect
to  and  okay  so  it's  easy  to  see  that
this  a  only  faceful  fun  but  the  highly
nontrivial  surprising  fact  is  that  there
actually  an  equivalence  so  when  you  can
glue  Vector
bundle
can  do  find  protection
mod  and  uh  somewhat  later  um  they  also
proved  that  there  is  some  version  of
this  that  works  for  some  kind  of
coherent  coherent  modules  but  I  don't
want  to  State  precise  the  because  of
precise  is  actually
Vector  extremely  let  me  just  say  there
is  a
burden  then  at  least  if  the  ring  is  the
recovers  the  expected  result  that  you
can
even  the  Rings  you  have  to  be
care  because  loation  not
be
yes
all  right  so  this  is  a  very  nice  result
it's
uh  like  basically  me  that  their  aim  at
the  time  was  just  to  prove  that  on
perfector  Spaces  you  can  R  Vector
bundles  uh  but  the  argument  some  worked
actually  whenever  just  chy
um  and  I  mean  I  could  kind  of  follow
their  argument  line  by  line  but  it's
some  kind  of  rather  tricky  argument
where  you  really  have  to  I  mean  when  you
have  a  desent  item  for  Vector  bundle
some  some  kind  of  invertible  Matrix  over
some  completion  of  your  ring  and  then
you  have  to  do  some  changes  of  bases  to
make  things  better  and  it's  actually
B  it's  an  actual
analysis
um  uh  and  so  today  I  want  to  explain  the
different  proofs  that  we  can  give  using
our  general  theory
uh  of  solid
modes
I  mean
using  this
way  I  should  maybe  say  that  next  some  10
years  ago  um  when  this  result  I  was  also
talking  to  K
and  he  was  some  already  telling  me  that
actually  like  if  you  work  in  the  deriv
category  and  you  look  at  some  kind  of
INB  up  modules  then  you  can  just  glue
and  I  was  like  okay  but  what  does  it
even  mean  like  we  have  all  these
problems  I  think  it's  not  a  structure
shap  and  it's  like  seems  highly  nony
through  Vector  mounts  and  so  on
so  what  does  it  extremely  General  result
actually  tell  you  about  such  complete
questions  and  uh  I  don't  know  whether  he
ever  like  figured  that  out  but  some  go
lecture  is  to  show  that  this  is  not  just
some
fancy  I  mean  the  S  result  for  this  SP
mod  was  kind  of  I  don't  know  abstract
and  so  maybe  didn't  see  much  happening
and  so  so  I  want  to  show  how  you  can
actually  get  down  to  something  more
concrete
today  okay  so  they  are  basically
uh
right  okay  so  the
outlines
um  so  first  of  all  and  this  is  some
addressing  what  G  already  wants  to  know
is  a  relation
between  um  the  thing  that
def
Andy  from  last
time  the  thing  that  naturally  comes  out
of  our
Ser
um  in  particular  we  will
actually  uh  it's  actually  true  that  if
it  so  happens  that  this  thing  is  is
Achieve  then  it  actually  happens  to
agree  always  with  our  she  uh  which  is
why  suddenly  the  good  things  happen
because  then  it  actually  has  a  correct
series  over  and  finds  the  correct
series
um  and  uh  the  second  thing  is  that
well  in
general  uh  sending
any  any  rational  substate
U
um  to  uh  let's  say  the  to  coherent
modules  in  non-  negative  horological
degrees
over
four  where  this  is  now
the  thing  that's  in  general  right  um  the
subat
of  um  this  is  a  sheap
of  we  cannot  just
glue  within  this  H  category  but  also
like  more  reasonable  objects  they  also
GL  to  reasonable  objects  and  then  once
you  like  in  the  most  General  case  that's
the  best  thing  you  can  hope  for  um  IT
addresses  like  the  subes  and  the  precise
formulation  of  this  result  for  two
modules  uh  but  once  you  restrict  the
vector  bound  you  can  then  proves  this
very  clean
result
maybe  I  should  also  say  that  the  ref
basically  reference  with  this  uh  done  in
more
detail  um  is  this  paper
of  okay
so  okay  so  the  first  thing  some  the
relations  so  let  me  call  the  other  just
oh
um
um  right  so  first  of  all  here's
a  that  Som  just  computes  those  sides
um  let's  say  you  have  such  a
um
subset
uh  so  I  say
from  do  I  need  it
here  in  my  mind  I'm  making  the  blanket
assumption  that  a  state  from  throughout
this  lecture  it  may  or  may  not  be
necessary  for  everything  I'm
saying
um  okay  so  this  be  the  Ral  Subs
um  here  I'm  really  using  this  uh  edic
spe  of  continuous  valuations  um  which
concretely  means  that  when  I  form  such  a
rational  subset  I  should  assume  that  uh
the  ideal  generated  by1  a  is  an  open
ideal  but  actually  once  you  have  top  op
unit  must  be  equal  to
a
um
then  first  of
all  uh
H  uh  is  given  by
taking  the  converion  power  series
algebra  variabl  G1  to  GN  and  then  moding
out  by  the  ideal  generates  by  dc1  minus
F1
D  um  and  taking  your
closure
um
I  this  is
basically  yeah  so  why  is  that  so  on  on
this  open  subset  but  first  of  all  you
didn't  invert  G  because  now  the  ideal
generated  by  G  contains  F1  up  to  FN  but
they  generate  unit  ideal  uh  so  the  ideal
generated  by  G  must  be  the  UN  ideal  so  G
has  become
invertible  even  without  taking  the
closure  um  and  then  on  this  also  so  you
have  now  T1  which  is  F1  over  G  and  all
it's  uh  converion  Power  Series  so  some
of  you  kind  of  this  is  what  could  happen
on  this  subset  where  this  less  equal  to
this  uh  but  I  mean  Huber  he  was  always
working  with  complete  topological  ring
so  when  you  take  aosion  by  something  you
also  take
aosion  by  the  closure  and
then  well  for  example  but  I  mean  I  mean
this  is  a  b  algebra  and  the  qu  by  any
close  that  still  a  b  algebra
still
okay  so
um  this  is  maybe  not  so  hard  to  show  and
uh  all  of
you  uh  I  recall  the
endomorphism  part
yes
uh  the  image  of
a  well  I  it's  a  thing  that's  just
defined  last  time  yeah
um  um  you
take  you  define  a
category  ring  structure  by  asking  for
this  complet  for  all  these
elements  and  uh  then  you  someh  look  at
what  the  completion  of  the  unit  actually
is  this  is  what  the  S  use  and  um  this
has  a  very  similar
formula  okay  want
but  then  take  the
Der  um  where
here
or  and  elements  I  want  to
R
uh  this  derived  quo
signifies  um  the  Der  base
strange
from  only
algebra  but  they  just  modify  all
the  variables  XI  so  basically  you're
setting  XI  also  to  zero  but  not  just  in
the  stupid  way  but  in  the  derived  way  um
and  completely  this  is  computed  by
possible
complex  and  in  the  middle  there  some
eyes  there  a  costal  differentials
and  this  just  by  taking  the  standard
resolution
of  Z  over
here  it  will  be  an  animated
condens  and  that's  why  I  will  consider
this  um  I  don't  really  want  to  talk
about  animated  things  today  uh  but  yeah
so
uh
just  yeah  so  it's  certainly  some  kind
of
algebra
let  me  just  give  a  sketch
it  um  and  for  the  second  part  so  you  can
write  A1  over  d  as
A1  mod  and  now  it's  not  really  necessary
whether  I  take  the  drive  or  not  but  it's
also  turn  the  drive  S  because  what  I
will  write  down  is  a  regular
sequest
um
and  then  you
solidify
uh
solidify  solidify
this  so  some  exact  operations  category
so  this  thing  is  just  comped  by  possible
complex  which  is  Con  a  fin  complex  fins
of  cop  of  The  Green  for  some  to
understand  what  this  some  of  this  C
thing  just  partial  solidification  so  you
just  have  to  understand  what  happens
when  you
solidify  uh  these  things  but  this  is
exactly  what  DUS  already  computed  that
someing
uh  he  had  to  say  that  if  you  uh  take  a
ring  or  take  a  fun  takes  a  module  and
joins  a  new  variable  T  and  then
solidifies  for  varibles  all  limits  and
Co  limits  and  so  some  of  then  you  can
write
a  first  of  all  a  zer
bring  of  definition  Pi  but  then  a  z  is
the  limit  of  a  z  not  pi  to  the  end  so
this  way  you  can  like  operation  of
joining  this  variables  and  then
solidifying
Jo  commute  this  description  of  a  as  a
limit  Co  limit  of  limits  and
so
okay  and  so  car  are  your  things  actually
that
saying  it's  the  same  thing  as  stating
all  which  is  a  context  but  zero  just  a
usual  Str
um  and  then  you  take  the  C
separated  a  small  inter
um  the
inclusion  uh
from  light  or  not  it  doesn't  really
matter  proba  separated  cond  set  inside
of  all  cond
set  it  hasn't  left  the
joint  I'll  take  any  x  to  the  qu  separate
potion  and  this  is  making  the  operation
of  taking  the  maximum  h  of
potion  and  I  can  practice  that  what  it
do
um  one  very  nice  feature  that  this  left
joint  has  for  non  obvious  reasons  is
actually  the  commut  with  finite  products
it  does  not  in  general  finite  limits  but
it  does  those  finite  products  uh  this
has  a  good  effect  that  uh  if  x  has  some
kind  of  alic  structure  like  being  a
group  or  ring  and  so  on  and  the  qual
funtion  all  that
isct
which
is  a  preservation  of  final  product  is
available  both  for  the  light  setting  and
all  condens  yes
l  i  mean  also  if
you  if  start  with  the  live  condenser  and
then  from  the  maximum  qu  SE  also  live
and  so  on  so  thank
you
um  right  uh
uh  so
completely  if  you  WR  X  as  a  of  some  by
rware  it's  I'm  telling  you  to  computers
left  the  joint  and  you  can  always  write
any  uh  any  condensed  set  as  a  potion  of
a  qu  separate  just  take  different  of
profile  subjecting  on  to
it  uh  then  there  exist  the
minimal  um  for
compact
injection  our  bar  and  R  that  is  also  an
equivalent
relation
and  uh
containing  um  R  so  it's  in  some  sense
taking  the  closure  of  R  intuitively
speaking  uh  but  sometimes  this  adds  new
things  which  where  solation  is  not
spreading  you  add  that  as  well  and  then
you  do  some  kind  of  trans  induction  or
you  just  intersect  all
possible  contain  intersection
station  and  so
then  X  this  is
xtion  this  is  X
Mod  because  uh  I  mean  this  x  was
separate  start  only  if  this  inclusion
here  relation  was  called  the
comp
and
so  um  so  for
example  yeah  so  if  if  if  x  happens  to  be
a  group  then  you  can  always  also  find  a
subjection  from  separated  condens  to  be
in  group  and  then  the  relation  is  just
the  qu  by  subgroup  in  that  case  you're
really  just  taking  the  qution  by  the
closure  of  the
subgroup  the  clure  in  the  sense  of  small
SP  injection  okay  so  here's  one  other
thing  I  should  recall
uh  which  is  what  do  qu  comp  injections
have  to  do  with  slau  as  I  was  pretending
they  have  um  let's  say  x  is  any
sequential
space  to  recall  it's  topological  space
for  those  uh  for  which  the  me
to  to  cond  set  is  fully
faceful  uh  in  the  close  substance  of
x  tively  to
the  uh  to  the  qu  compact
injections  underl  taking
any
uh  taking  it  easy
here
so  for  example  why  if  you  start  with  the
close  subset  here  why  is  it  actually
forther  compact  injection  while  to  check
that  the  definition  is  that  whenever  you
pull  back  to  some  profinite  set  then  the
pre-image  uh  this  is  a  f  compact
injection  but  this  precisely  means  that
the  the  other  gu  is
also  and  so  the  preimage  in  this  case  is
uh  just  the  close  stop  of  this  profile
set  byose  close  subset  here
um
and  yeah  close  subset  of  Prof  set  is  a
profite  set  and
compa  using  using  that  X  has  some  of
potion  topology  from  profile  set  you  can
kind  of  also  reverse
it
okay
um  and
so  uh  okay  so  back  to  the
SC  what  is
5  uh  well  this  is
just  the  thing  and  then  you  take  the
ex
okay
um  and
then  if  you  take  a  qu  separated  potion
well  this  guy  is  already  qu  separated
and  then  by  above  and  because  this  here
is  actually  sequential  comes  from  a
sequential  topological  space  um  this
precisely  means  that  I  should  just
replace  this  one  here  by
Disclosure
which  is  uh
what
um  right  and  so  uh  this  are  gives  us
some  relation  um  but  we  interested  in  a
somewhat  more  precise  relation  um  which
is  a  following
serum  that's  potentially  do
tralia  uh  except  that  he  didn't  uh  use
this  language  to  phrase  it  but  I  mean
the  proof  is  really  his  um  that
uh  a  plus
CP  if
only  who
stru  or  if  you  just  pH  in  terms  of  all
series  all  you
rational  or  VI  fits  in  degree
zero
and  okay  so  let  me  give  the
proof
um  uh  this  is  clear
because  uh  by  the  general  desend  results
from  the  last  lecture  we  have  the  she  of
categories  but  in  particular  like  you
get  a  sheath  of  rings  and  we  just  take
those  unit  and  uh  this  is
over  and  uh  so  sheep  and  then  well  she
um  the  non-trivial  and  I  think  somewhat
surprising  result  is  that  if  it  so
happens  to  be  Shey  then  actually  it  is
the  right
thing  let  me  get  SK  the  other  direction
um  uh  and  before  I  start  uh  note  that  uh
to  check  this  property  that  all  you6
degre  Z  and  prob  separated  it  suffices
to  show  that  this  true  on  a  further
refinement  of  you  U  further  cover  of  you
because  you  can  always  recover  it  by  all
the  smaller  values  as  a  limit  um
so  and  then  as  St  didn't  use  it  last
time  there  are  all  these  arguments  that
General  Ral  coverage  and  so  on  they  can
always  refined  by  this  uh  simple  wrong
covers  uh  and  actually  the  second  type
of  cover  that  you  use  it's  actually  not
necessary  uh  in  this  the  state  setting
um
so
uh  right  so  so  so
so
to  get  take  the  good
property  of  all
view  after  be
further  uh
Sur  and  I  don't  want  to  go  through  all
those  Comm  does  refinement  and  just  uh
notes  that  some  following  uh
ke
also  and  always  refin
but
we  can  always  any  space  with
Locus  at  most  one  and  at  least
one  uh  so  the  other  type  of  cover  is  not
necessary  when  you  to  new  units  um  and
so  this  reduces  to  the  key  to  the
following  uh
s
uh  so  sa
inte  and  F  the
L  and
assume
o
this  a  sequence  of
EX  um  actually  what  does  chiness  mean
chiness  I  mean  so  this  is  of
x  all
ubber
s  so  let  me  to  zero  here
um  this  a
Lo  and  this  just  BL  achieve  condition
says  right  so  if  you  want  to  give  a
thing  here  you  have  to  give  one  here  and
this  open  cover  and  they  to  agree  on
intersection  it's  actually  always  true
that  the  last  m  is  objective  just
because  any  element  in  here  can  be
written  as  of  sum  of  f  to  the  ends  and
one  over  F  to  the  ends  and  the  F  To  The
Ends  come  from  here  one  F  to  the  end
come  from  here  so  so  activity  on  the
right  is  always  true
um  never  mind  that  uh  so  assume  this
which
is  always  Pro  of
H  because  it's  just  one  specific
instance  of  the  sheet  ex
um  then  actually
uh
this
is  the  deriv  Cent
by  F  and  the  other  thing  is  also
the  I
don't  so  in  other  words  it  agrees  with
with  uh  the  thing  that  we
Define  or  I  also  what  does  this  D  I  mean
it  means  that  modifcation  by  minus  f  is
actually  injective  here  and  it  has
closen
um  right
so  uh  let's  Pro  this  so  what  you  have  to
see  what  I  just  said  so  that  if  you  look
at
on  and  then  multiply  by  say
F  or
by
go  that  this  is  injective  with
close
sure
um  but  actually  because  of  star  um  like
for  example  if  you  want  to  show
injectivity  uh  let's  assume  you  have
something  in  the  kernel  that  also  still
lies  in  the  kernel  when  you  replace  a  by
one  of  those  two  rings  but  then  over
those  two
rings  uh  it's  I  will  argue  that  it's
easy  to  see  that  this  net  actually  is
injective
um  uh  but  then  this  map  here  we  assume
to  be  injective  and  so  uh  we  get
injectivity  and  similarly  this  map
actually  has  closed  image
because  the  image  is  precis  the  crel  of
the  next  map
um
and  uh  and  so  using  this  you  can  also  uh
um  check  that  if  if  on  over  these  Rings
it  has  closed  image  and  also  here  it
must  have  closed  image
so  it's  enough  to  take  it  when  once  we
replace  a  by  those  two  rings  in  other
words  we  can  assume
uh  they  see  that  either  the  abute  value
of
s  letal  to
one  one  of
the
um
uh  but  uh  when  for  example  f  is  less
equal  to  one  then  T  minus  F  you  can
actually  easily  show  that  it's  a  close
IDE  deal  because  it  can  just
successively  like  heill  off  the  highest
coefficient  uh  and  something  similar
here  so  uh  yeah  those  two  Cas  actually
something
you
you  can  really
just  I  mean  if  you  have  an  element  here
you  can  really  just  by  looking  at
coefficients  kind  of  see  what
happens
and  also  like  I  once  it  it's  a  base
change  actually  one  of  them  becomes  a
toy  anyways  because  like  not  doing  any
further  localization  it's  only  the  other
one  you  have  to  check
uh
basically  say  f  one  then  the  second
thing  is  the  one  where  you  ask  that  F
has  also  absolute  greater  equal  to  one
but  this  basically  just  means  that  you
invert  F  the  Ring  of  integral  elements
and  so  already  I'm  the  level  of  a  z  if
become  the  localization  and  then  things
are
good
okay
so  this  is  this  funny  argument  that  K
found  that  if  you  just  assume  the  T
thing  is  a  CH  then  you  can  yeah  reduce
this  problem  and  it's  some  criticals
that  you  can  reduce  to  the  simple  wrong
covers  where  you  just  take  a  potion  by
one  element  because  then  the  question
what  do  R  potion  is  is  really  just  the
question  whe  this  one  M  here  is
injective  is  close  image  um  yeah  this
can  be
red  okay  so  this  uh  um  finish  is  my
discussion  about  the  she  condition  and
the  relation  between
H
struct  um  and
so  now
uh
to  the  second
part  so  here  here
definitions  what  does  the  me  so  let
R  Qui
say  no  cond  structure  for  now
um  uh  then  some  something
like  um  this  definition  S6  I
believe
uh  if  it  can  be
represented
by
complex  goes  up  to  some  cus  n
but
Z  go  all
the  um  yeah  so  there  is  some  stuff  here
here  it  goes  only  to  the  left
um  and  all  these  terms  must  be
finite  you  could  also  say  try  project
this  with
negative  let  actually  fin  projected
because  I  want  to  say  something  else  in
a  second  and  then
important
um  so  if  your  ring  was  an  aan  then  this
will  just  be  the  or  more  generally
conent  this  would  just  be  the  condition
that
each  each  I  mean  it's  bounded  to  the
right  and  each  group  is  a  coherent
module  the  case  just  finally  generated
module  but  can  go  arit  part  of
the  um  if  you're  notan  range  then
there's
some  cerent  modul  St  form  in  a  be
category  usually  and  so
uh  because  you  didn't  ask  that  the
relations  between  the  relations  are  fin
generated  and  so  some  of  the  infinite
complexes  they  capture  the  idea  that  you
have
modules  which  I  finally  generate  with  s
many  relations  s  many  further
relations
so
like  I  guess  point  is  that  over  in  the
Ser  it's  a  good  class  of  like  f
generated  modules  behaving  nicely  you
don't  have  that  over  General  ring  but
the  ring  still  the  right  nice  of
complex
um  and  uh  let  is
perfect  if  there  is  such  a
representation  which  just  wanted
to  found  it  just  a  fire  compx  project
mod
and  then  the  serum  is
that  um  let's  say  a
A+  is  any
H
um  um  the  a
state
then  sending
any
you
start  uh  to  the  following  uh  things  so
on  the  one  hand  you  can
take  perer
guys  um  all  the
ones  or  you  can  take  two  clearent  ones
that  are  say  in  degrees  greater  equal  to
zero  or  greater  equal  to  n  for  any
n  um  we  could  also  take  all  perfect
complexes  but  you  could  also  take  those
perfect
complexes  which  have  such  a
representation  in  some
interval  so  per  ad  means  those  that  can
be  represented  using  a  complex  sitting
The  Source
degrees
uh  so  these  are  all  funs  that  take  a  Ral
subet  to  Infinity  category
and  they  all  threee  cly  and  claim  that
they  all  sh
of  on  the  right  I'm  always  just  thinking
of  a  as
a  satisfy  that  I  really  just
Lang  so  these  are
modules
being
reason  Peter  you  didn't  have  a
dependence  on  you  on  the  right  hand  side
I  did  not  thank  you
uh  um  and  I  guess  inally  I'm  uh  now
extending  all  these  Notions  to  animated
Rings
um  and  so  okay  so  either  you  know  what
all  these  things  mean  when  this  guy  is
just  in  animated  ring  then  it's  true  as
stated  or  you  secretly  that  you  maybe  in
the  she  case  where  is  just  con  zero  and
then  I  just  told  you  what  they  are
either  way  these  are  she
of  in  particular  the
case
uh  Ser  0  if  I  exed  the  vector  bundles
this
cover
yeah  Peter  is  there  a  reason  you  didn't
State  the  like  pseudo  coherent
AB  uh  uh
uh  no
okay  you  have  to  be  be  careful  that  the
good  way  to  make  uh  uh  UD  restrictions
on  CHS  and  a  perfect  complex  are
different  yeah  for  perfect  complex  you
assume  that  there  is  a  representation  as
an  actual  complex  that's  in  some  range
of  degrees  for  carean  Chiefs  you  can
just  Mak  more  a  naive  thing  like  B  to
degrees  in  which
it's  although  no  there  is  actually  a
reason  uh  if  I  no  there  is  a  reason
because  look  I  don't  think  localizations
are  flat  in  any  generality  here  so  you
could  have  something  that's  zero  then
you  localize  go  further  to  the  left
won't  won't  they  be  flat  I  mean  on  the
level  the  discreet
Rings  maybe  not
always  I  still  I  think  an  open  question
whether  for  perfector  space  is  a
localization  set  ref  okay  everybody
expect  wrong  but  I  don't  think
anybody  okay  so  I  guess  I  only  have  half
an  hour  remaining  so  let  me  uh  uh  just
give  an  overline  of  the  overview  of  the
argument
so  I  mean  I  said  this  is  in  this  paper
of  Gregory
andf
um  and  we  also  gave  the  we  proved  the
analog  of  this  result  in  CA  on  complex
geometry  and  uh  the  same  argument  as
there  works
here  uh  but  okay  let  meall
theum
uh  so
we  we  know  that  this  fun  takes  any  you
to
like
um
and  okay  this  will  have  a  meaning  some
point  when  this  is  animated
uh  we  didn't  discussed  yet  so  uh  if  you
feel  more  comfortable  just  assume  this
sits  zero  and  this  cas  um  then  this  is  a
sheet
of  any
cator  and  so  this  certainly  contains
fully
faceful  uh  just  the  modules  over  the
underline  the  SC  ring  that's  always
true  um  for  any  antic  ring  whatsoever
um  and  this  certainly  contains  all  these
other
subcategories
but  yeah  basically  some  kind  of  yeah
this  is  some  kind  of  fin  solu
here
CL  um
and  so  by  virtue  of  this  being  fully
faceful  uh
the  it  means  that  the  only  thing
actually  have  to  prove  in  all  these
settings  is  that  if  you  have  an  object
here  uh  which  locally  happens  to  line
all  of  the  subies  and  actually  so
globally
um  and  maybe  at  the  expense  of
pretending  that  I  can  replace  all  of  you
by  a  again
um  that  this  is  this  is  such  that  uh
over  over
cover  like  the  base  change
from  a  plus
col  one  of  the  sub
categories
then  so
does  so  the  conditions  that  we  put  they
they
GL
okay
um  and  so  maybe  the  first  idea  you  might
have  is  that  well  let's  first  check  that
this  condition  of  being  like  module
discrete  module  the  sense  and  then  you
the  sess  conditions  but  this  actually
does  not
work  warning  this  is  a  warning  that
Dustin  already  made  but  I  want  to
reiterate  it  because  it's  important
um  uh  the
conditioning  noise  sorry  uh  this  does
not
just  say
Global  it's  do  locally  that  will  not
be  globally  um  let  me  actually  quickly
sketch  the  one  example  um  I'm  not  sure
it's  the  easiest  example  but  somewhat
destructive
um  let's  consider  take  the  curve  so  it
takes
the  um  TM  Spains
over  let's  say
PP
um  and  then  you  can  take  the  qu  by  let's
say  other  unit  so  this  what's  called
table
different  with  the  analog  of  taking  C
Star  Complex  space  c  star  and  po  by  some
topolog  element  and  then
this  becomes
atic  curve  complex  numbers  do  similar
SLE  or  fi  this  some  how  rigid  geometry
started
um  uh  and  let's  let's  let's  assume  that
our  spa  a  plus  is  some  large  open  large
open  subset
here  so  basically  remove  a  small  disc
around  the  war  one  Genesis  um  but  large
some  see  that  there  is  non  with  global
monog  um  but  should  spit  back  should
really  be  sub  only  ofion  and  not  this
yeah  and  then  there  is  C  the  projection
that
yeah
ring  um
and  then  you
can
um  find  what  I  will  call  a  lower  streak
of  sub
here
um  what  do  what  is  this  well
locally  locally  this  map  is  just  split
and  so  locally  on  the  base  like  the  P
are  just  disc  Union  of  copies  of  of  the
base  in  Tak  by  the  integers  and  then  the
she  is  just  a  direct  sum  of  copies  of
this  of  this
same  and  and  so  this  this  how  defined
locally
and  well  it's  obviously  a  sheath  and  so
it  gles  to  some  sheath  on  on  the  base  so
this  this  defines  for  you  object  daa
plus
solid  because  locally  it
does
um  and  it  is  locally  discreet  because
locally  as  I  said  this  coverage  of
splits  and  this  is  just  a  bunch  of
copies  of  of  your  Bas  instead  men  um  but
you  can  check  that  globally  it  is  the
speed  and
exercise
okay  so  um  we  can't  hope  to  um  I  this
category  instead  we  will  use  to  to  other
Notions
so  we  said  you  can  first  also  Define
this  kind  of  PUD  in
oan
um
uh  where  now  I
mean  yeah  it's  again  the  complexes  which
are
represented  um
by  um  something
that's  bounded  to  the  right  so  goes  to
the
left  and
oci
are  in  this  case  I  just  say  they  are
equals
to  all  right  like  projective  mod  uh  I
guess  in  when  I  say  it  like  this  I
assume  that  that  P  is  also  still  degree
zero  um  in  general  you  should  do  the
appropriate  thing  where
St  there's  a  different  way  to
characterize  this
as  X  Out  of  the  Sky  Computing  with
f
you  meant  mod  AA  plus
solid  yes  thank
um  the
right
e
um  so  you  define  this
and  show  that
property  applying  their
globalized
and  you  actually  just  use  I  first  of  all
being  bounded  to  the  right  is  a  proper
that  globalizes  because  you're  locally
bounded  to  the  right  and  then  globally
you're  just  some  kind  of
finite  limit  of  suction  so  there  still
bound  to  right  um  and  so  then  you  need
to  check  this  x  condition  and  and  to
check  that  the  only  thing  you  need  is
that  these  localizations  have  found  the
to  amplitude  uh  otherwise  there  would  be
issue  with  some  issue  but  during  that
localizations  b  to  the  left  this  far
um
for
okay
so  this  fire  condition  on  the  big
category  uh  this  can  you  to  S  it  and
then  actually  once  you  have  the  fire
this
condition  then  the  thisness  is  also
something  that  can  be  uh  just  globalized
but  this
actually  not  you  need  to  how  prove  it
and  some  equivalent  what  you  want  to
prove  um  so  the  issue  there  up  there
that
it'sin
um  and
so  to  do  the  actually  is  second  subass
of  n  objects  and  this  a  plus  and  these
are  soal  nuclear
objects
object  so  maybe  we  will  discuss  them
much  more  generously  uh  in  much  more
detail  later  let  me  just  give  a  um  quick
definition
here  so  all  the  speed  ones  will  be
modular  but  things  are  somewhat  more
General  than  that  um  so  in  particular
they  contain  all  B  modes  but  not  the
Smith  ones
um  so  let's  say
C  so  the  name  is  inspired  by  this  uh
class  of  nuclear  Vector  space  gr  defined
in  function
analysis
um  it's  not  a  completely  precise
translation  but  like  in  spirit  it  is
one
it's  the  following  condition  satisfied
so  it  takes
the  internal
home
P  so  p  as  usual  is  my  I  should  have  said
before  I  mean  this  is  my
usual
mod
so  you  have  that  the  other  one  way  to
produce  Maps  is
to  start  with  a  dual  of  B  and  then
tensor
uh  and  these  are  in  some  kind  of  of
Trace
CL
so  this  in  some  way  incling  the  idea
that  all  M
from  uh  so  a  couple  of  comments  about
the
definition
um  so  in  general  the  nuclear  actually  in
this  case  uh  the  nuclear
modules  yeah  generated  the
colon
shifts  um
by  uh  just  B  up
module  Z  function
from  if  you  want  it  also  a  Jo  T  but  just
as  a
mod
um  so  in
general  um  you  can  generate  them  by  full
limits
um
the
um  in  general  referring  to  more  General
analytic  Rings  um  by  where  these  are  all
Trace  meaning  they  come  from  they  come
from  element  and  Qi  dual
s  whenever  you  have  an  element  in  the
stand  Pro  you  can  produce  a  m  from  Q  one
these  are  all  Trace  class  and  then  if
you  take  a  sequential  form  of  Trace
class  Maps  uh  you  can  check  using  that
internal  home  comms  uh  limits  that
people  always
have  and  conversely  when  you  try  to
start  presenting  nuclear  object  in  terms
of  How  It's  generated  by  compact
projectors  and  some  take  a  five  comple
compact  projectors  mapping  into  C  but
then  that  map  will  actually  fact  will  be
Trace  class  and  you  can  Factor  it  over
like  Trace  class
map
right
okay  and  so  yeah  in  particular  like  over
QP  this  is  stuff  generated  by
B  uh  so  this  is  still  a  rather  large
class
of  guys  it  will
actually  I  mean  there  actually  Ser  about
cies  and  so  on  one  very  nice  property
this  nuclear  module  that  form  a  category
Universal  lra  approximation  in  some
sense  to  the  right  hand  side  um  and
using  this  you  can  also  Define  the  cas
the  of  tic  spaces  uh  which  is  and  see
this  but  taking  us
the  field
uh  um  so  back  to  here  uh  so  you  have  the
sub  of  ble  guys  and  uh  so  the  finest
Class
end  then  you  show  that  this  top
Global  and
so  so  you  want  to  check  that
if  you  have  some  C  and  it  satisfies  this
condition  locally  then  you  want  to  check
it
globally  uh  and  for  this  ideal  situation
is  that  just  that  those  sides  of  the
isph  can  just  localize  well  the  right
hand  side  is  just  some  tensoring  so  the
right  hand  side  definitely  like
localizes
um  the  question  is  for  the  left  hand
side  also  does  and  it  actually  does  and
so  the  key  thing  is
that
uh  here  said  theal  from
P  from
loal  but  this  is  the  same  argument  that
just  use  last  time  to  show  the  different
localization  with  each  other  because
they  actually  show  that  all  the
localizations  are  given  by  internal  home
from  some  object
uh
that's  a  different  internal  homes  can
meet  with  each
other  okay
so  I  mean  Peter  I  mean  strictly  speaking
uh  that's  not  um  I  mean  for  like  an
algebraic  uh  localization  inverting  an
element
um  you  know  it's  not  literally  internal
hum  from  some  object  spaces  and  they  all
rational  subsets  like  inverting  an
element  is  not  a  rational
subset  so  but  a  general  I  should  say
what  a  suitable  the  large  bations  but
yeah  yeah  I  mean  there's  a  and  yeah  in
any  case  you  can  always  refine  further
so  that  it  is  yeah  I  just  wanted  to  just
in  case  there  was  some  confusion  about
that
um  well  actually  also
right  Ian  also  with  the  other  types  of
because  it's  also  Comm  with  element
because
it  limits
but  okay
um  and
so  so  now  we  isolate  with  two  classes
these  things  that
are  the  sense  of  spe  category  uh  and
these
Nu  so  excuse  me  so  the  the  consider  this
question  of  commu  localization  it  seems
that  the  sketchy  argument  you  gave
doesn't  use  that  you  you  put  their  P  you
can  put  anything  not  necessarily  compact
instead  of  p  is  it  right  and  this
community  localization  which  is  contrary
to  what  we  have  for  schemes  where  you
have  to  take  underlying  home  from
something  bit  surprising  so  actually  in
this  case  also
localizations
um  uh  they  Comm  with  all  products
because  they  have  a  left  to  joint  which
is  something  we'll  discuss  uh  and  which
is  extremely  important  for  this  whole
theory  of  compax  SP  coherent  mod  that
actually  in  these  situations  the
pullback  funter  there's  a  kind  of
coherent  lower  Street  functor  which
is  yeah  is  the  left  joint  so  the
pullback  all  limits  but  it's  also  uh
satisfies  projection  formula  lower  stre
and  this  is  precisely  uh  equivalent  to
this  internal  home  so  it  is  true  for
anything  instead  of  P  it's  true  for
anything  instead  of  p  uh  this  okay
um  for  these  variant  it  do  mentioned
it's  however  again  important  that  this
col  but  for  the  precise  localization
we're  interested  in  here  to  Russ  open
subsets  it's  actually  always
true  um  right  and  I  should  wrap  up  and
so  then  okay  so  we  made  two  steps  in  our
proof  we  isolate  two  different  classes
of  uh  modules  that  uh  can  be  glue
uh  and  then  the  last  step  is  to  like
isolate  then  also  intersection  and  then
the  last  step  is  show
that  to  Cent  guys
over  Soo  it's  just  an
inclusion  uh  so  they  are  certainly  in  s
of  spe
categor  and  they
also  this  is  actually
called  and  so  then  you  finally  shows
that  you  can  GL  this  two  ones  then
there's  still  a  little  bit  to  show  that
all  the  other  super  and  subscripts  I  put
also  glue  but  this  is  actually
easy
and
so  right  so  far  I  didn't  do  anything
that  seem  remotely  like
analysis  um  but  some  of  doing  a  vctor
bundles  there  is  actually  some  new  verus
power  series  that  you  have  to  undertake
somewhere  um  so  somewhere  there  has  to
be  some  like  actual  word  right  and  so
it's  some  on  this  step  and  let  me
actually  uh  show  how  it's  done
uh
intersection  and  uh  so  we  can  assume  we
have  some  compx  and  by  shifting  you  can
assume  it  starts  z
um
and  and  I  also  said  you  can  assume  that
these  are  all  just
okay  you  have  such  a  complex  how  we  know
that  it  is
nuclear
right  but
now  but  now  I  certainly  have  a  m  from  P
to  here  which  is  just  the  identity  here
and  like  my  complex  is  just  zero  sare
right
complexes  um  this  is  a  map  from  from  P
into  C
right  now  being  nuclear  it  means  that
it's  uh  Trace
class  and  uh  so  if  you  actually  have  a
section  in  here  then  again  you  can
Factor  this  over  some  approximation  to  C
and  so  uh  when  you  think  a  little  bit
about  what  this  means  uh  then  you
realize  that  can
actually
um  there  exist  a  diagram  like
this  uh
where  G  say  where  where  Gus
PR  but  then  this  is  actually  subjective
so  this  F  can  actually  be  split  back  and
da  da  da  da  da  and  so  you  get  actually
some  morphism  here  and
actually  what  you  uh  see  with  this  is
that  the
map  from  P  to
C  tectors
over  um  the  me
phone  uh
oneus  g  to  p  for  some  and  G  of
P
is  just  some  playing  around  with  I  know
the  fact  that  P  is  projected  and  so  on
and  the  definition  of  nuclearity  redu  pH
F  things  and  so
so  right
so  in  the  end  you  see  that  there  is
actually  a  way  to  put  oneus
here
and  so  then  it's  actually  enough  to  show
that  this  guy
here  uh  it's  actually  lies  it's  actually
perfect
cont  and  certainly  this  is  this
representations  have  written  it  doesn't
show  that  but  they  claim  far  as  to  compx
that  these  are  just  three  modules
here  and  this  is  basically  classical  fre
home  Theory  so  if  you  have  a  trace
operator  the  identity  map  is  fre
operator  and  then  youur  this  by  TR  C  in
particular  compact  operator  and  then  any
perturbation  of  a  fre  Operator  by
compact  operator  still  fre  fre  operator
some  have  properties  that  are  kernel  and
cor  kernal  dimensional
and  this  is  argument  that  you  just  have
to  execute  slightly  more  carefully  in
the  situation  so  this  is  some  pH
operator  on  this
like  bace  something  like  this  and  then
uh  uh  you  can  show  that  yeah  some  the
cone  on  F  operator  is  a  perfect  complex
which  is  better  way  of  thinking  that's
the  K  and  generate  and  so  this  is  the
only  place  where  you  actually  have  to
play  R  with  some  I  mean  you  have  to
Matrix  representing  G  and  then  you  play
lower  it's  easy  but  there  this  is  a  step
where  you  actually  feel  like  you're
doing  somewhat  a  little  bit  of  analysis
okay  that
is
questions  so  anyways  to  understand  this
so  before  you  you  erased  actually  the
Blackboard  is  fuzzy  you  can't  see  it  you
can't  read  the  the  right  Blackboard  from
here  uh  I  don't  know  what  what's  but
before  you  erase  what  you  have  written
before  you  had  a
factorization  where  P  okay  now  it's  okay
so  P2P  you  said  that  you  factorize  it
through  p  and  one  map  is  Trace  class
right  but  it  it  seems  to  me  that  it  is
you  have  to  use  hom  I  mean  the  data  will
not  give  you  that  the  map  from  P2P  is  is
you  you  need  some  homotopy  to  do  it  I
mean  uh  I  think  the  data  is  probably
that  where  it's  executed  look  at  the
complex  geometry  not  where  we  do  precis
the  same  argument  like  this  liquid
Vector  space  and
so  it  is  UN  for  thing  that  I'm  probably
screwing  up  if  I  try  to  do  it  right  here
but  but  in  any  case  the  data  probably
means  that  the  map  from  P  to  the  complex
is  homotopic  to  a  map  that  factorizes
through  a  finitely  generated  freea
module  up  to
homotopic  yeah  and  then  you  can  use  this
finally  generated  frea  module  to  modify
the  so  this  way  I  can  modify  the  complex
that  now  degree
zero  it  becomes  zero  and  then  I  can  just
keep  going  and  yeah  yeah  okay  well  maybe
it's  the  same
approximately  yeah  thanks  thanks
Peter  did  you  figure  out  the  question  by
the  way  no
sorry

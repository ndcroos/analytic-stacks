  e
so  the  main  thing  I  want
to  uh  talk  about  today  uh  is  the  form  of
six  funs  for
step  um  but  before  I  get  there  uh  let
me  uh  try  to  say  I  mean
something  that  kind  of  Dustin  kind  of
said  uh  last  time  and  that  I  kind  of
also  said  last  time  but  we  both  didn't
quite  really  do  uh  is  to  do  the
construction  but
first  um  the
construction  of  the
norm  on  the  SK
fa
um  and  so
uh
conveniently
uh  Dustin  kind  of  already  explained  that
we  can  assume  uh  that  we  actually  uh
have  all  the  roots  of  Q  as
well
um  and  so  then  we  want  to  define  the
algebra  that  corresponds  to  the
locus  uh  where  the  absolute  value  of  T
is  at  most
R  and
uh  or  like  like  the  over  convergent
functions  on  this  disc  and  as  Dustin
explained  the  ex  of  Norm  some  uh  tell
you  that  this  has  to  be
um  like  there's  an  if  guess  for  what
this  might  be  so  this  might  be  like  this
this  free  algebra  on  the  to  on  the  top
element  t  or  scale  suitably  so  that  um
the  norm  is  equal  to  R  uh  but  that's  not
quite  right  but  it's  almost  right  but
when  you  pass  the  over  convergence  thing
then  it  actually  becomes  exactly  correct
uh  so  there's  a  CO  liit  over
all
um  I  know  it's
called  um  such
that  uh  ah  so  I  will  use  I  will
construct  the  norm  for  which  the
absolute  value  of  Q  will  be  a
half  and  so  I  want  to
take  this  here  A  and  so  I  want  to  take  a
p  a  module  on  a  top  l
element  where  I
rescale  T  by  some  power  of
cube  uh  and  so  this  should  be  such  that
this  definitely  converges  here  so  we
want  that  we  should  secretly  think  that
maybe  the  norm  of  t  r  um  and  then  we
want  the  norm  of  Q  to  the  T  *  T  this
should  be  bigger  than  one  but  okay  so
this  is  the  nor  of  Q  is  half  so  a  half  T
*  R  should  be  bigger  than  one  and  now
you  can  do  the  algebra  so  this  means
that  2  to  T  must  be  less  than  R  so  you
take  the  co  liit  of  all  t  for  which  two
to  T  is  less  than
R
uh  yeah  so  this  is  a  condition
that  sorry  am  I  doing  this  right
sorry  this  should  be  less  than  this
should  be  less  than  one
sorry  right  so  this  is  a  condition
that  like  if  R  is  very  large  say
then  sorry  am  I  doing  this
right  um  then  we  should  multiply  by  a
large  power  of  Q  to  make  it  somewh  small
yeah  this  seems  right
okay  was  a  disagreement  or  no  no  just  uh
just
commiseration  okay  thanks  um  so  so  uh
this  has  is  the  only  possible  choice  is
what  you  explained  last
time
um  and  uh  so  what  we  have  to  see  is  that
uh  um  these  unimportant  have  all  the
required  properties  to  Define
uh
uh  well  first  of  all  you  have  to  see
this  Al
item
and
they  plus  the  anog  for  G
inverse  and
inin  uh  Define
map  uh
so  analog  infity
okay
okay  now  you  can  replace  T  by  T  inverse
and  then  the  T  supp  Infinity
um  all  right  so
uh  so  here  here  are  some  ways
to  and  I  mean  all  of  these  are  some  kind
of  simp  computations  um  uh  let  me  just
check  that
uh  the  locus
where  uh  it's  at  least  R  and  the  locus
where  it's  bigger  than  equal  to  to  S
where  R  is  less  than  S  this  would  be
empty  and  for  this  you  have  to  compute
uh  something  like  you  take  a  and  then
join  to  T  *  T
head
um  and  say
noers
uh  and  then  you  can  draw
in  T
and  the  S  time  T  head  inverse  um  he  want
that  sorry
this  um  you  want  to  show  that  uh  such  a
thing  is  zero  for
if
say
um  and  one  situation  says  R  is  less  than
one  after  resaling  you  can  assume  that
some  one  is  squeezed  in  between  them
um  and  so  then  you  can  assume  that  t  is
negative  and  S  is  also
negative
um
but
uh
um  right  uh
but
so  in  particular  here  you  have  map
from  two  toping  elements  which  are  uh  so
X  goes  to  Q  to  the  T3  and  Y  goes  to  Q
F  and  uh  say  satisfies  relation  that  if
you  multiply  the  two  you  get  something
the  negative  power  of  s  so  Yus  Q  to  the
I  don't  know
some
axy  is  equal  to  zero  where  a  is  some
positive
number  sorry  this  supp
to  and  so  but  uh  and  in  turn  if  you  just
remember  the  product  so  then  you  also
have
this  is  an  algebra  over  a  Jo  C  Aus  a  *
C  but  this  is  precisely  I  mean  a  join  Z
head  this  is  precisely  this  projective
generator  uh  that  we  always
use  and  then  here  you're  doing  oneus  Q
to  the  a  *
shift  and  if  a  was  equal  to  one  then  we
precisely  declared  this  to  be  an
isomorphism  on  the  projective  generator
in  the  gas  is  ring  structure  uh  and  I
also  explained  somewhere  that  the  power
doesn't  really  matter  when  you  do  this
so  This  implies  the  pr  fractional  power
so  this  is  actually
zero  and  this  is  really  by  the
definition  of
the
right  so  so  like  the  minimal  thing  we
really  need  to  to  get  this  map  is  that
know  this  which  shouldn't  intersect  do
not  intersect  uh  and  this  really  exactly
comes  down  to  uh  the  thing  we  enforce
and  the
guesses  and  then  there  are  some  other
things  you  have  to  check
and  none  of  the  computations  is
hard
so  those  and  then  you  have  to  check  they
cover  that  the  guys  like  the  they  need
to  check  the  cover  but  again  for  this
you  just  have  to  show  that
um  yeah  actually  I  will  probably  come  to
this  later  in  the  course  again  but  I
mean  basically  you  just  have  to  like  if
you  say  we  SCT  to  the  Fine
Line  then  you  just  have  to  show  that  I
mean  that
then  you  expect  that  there  is  some  they
form  a  cover  and  so  they  expect  that
there  is  some  St  like  sequence  like
functions  on  the  fine  line  just
pooms  going  to  functions  on  a  dis  and
functions  on  functions  on  the  opposite
dis  and  then  functions  of  the  overlap
and  for  all  of  these  things  you  can  just
write  down  what  they  are  and  then  just
check  that  you  get  an  exact  sequence  and
this  implies  the  covering  condition
because  it  implies  that  uh  the
polinomial  are
generated  uh  by
uh  in  a  finary  way  by  modules  over  over
the  ah  okay  so  you  just  have  to  check  a
cyclicity  like  the  analog  of  data
cyclicity  you  just  have  to  check  theity
I
mean  this  is  I  mean  this  is  enough  to
Che  the  covering  conditions  by  the  way
the  reason  that  we  really  want  to  use
this  uh  this  grow  topology  that  we  chose
uh  so  I  think  there's  another
perspective  here  that  makes  some  of
these  things  easier  which  is  like
instead  of  using  this  this  uh  free  thing
on  a  topologically  nil  poent  it's  like
the  free  think  where  you  make  t
topologically  nil  potent  which  is  not
really  like  a  a  subset  you  could  use  the
subset  where  te  becomes  gaseous  like  an
analytic  ring  that's  not  induced  but
they're  all  sandwiched  between  each
other  so  for  the  over  convergent  thing
it  doesn't  matter  and  then  um  and  then
uh  at  least  you  have  honest  subsets  and
then  it's  like  kind  of  easier  to  check
which  subset  oh  like  I'm  saying  there's
a  instead  of  using  this  thing  I  was
calling  d  as  your  basic  dis  you  could
instead  use  an  analytic  ring  which  is
the  analytic  ring  gotten  by  forcing  the
coordinate  T  to  be  gaseous  in  the  sense
of  like  one  minus  t  *  shift  what  was  D
oh  D  was  just  the  spec  of  the  p
r  this  array  which  is  this  U  let  me  so  I
keep  my  notation  keeps  this
notation  uh  which  to  the  line  and  then
projective  line  so  that's  one  thing  you
can  consider  on  the  other  hand  um  you
can  also
um  Define  the  following  funny  analytic
ring  so  you  can  take
um
um  we  can  start  with  the
polinomial  and  then  make  t  guessers  uh
in  the  sense  that  you  enforce  uh  1  minus
key
*  oh  sorry  uh  yes  and  for  is  one  minus  t
*  shift  as  usual  on  Project  generator  uh
to
be
Aus  what  is  sh  here  I  mean  uh
on  on  this  tbas  change  to  this
ring
um  and  so  this  is  also  an  analytic
R
um  and  you  can  also  take  the  aspect  of
this
and  this  is
actually  a  Subspace  of  of  P1  over  a
um  and  it's  again  a  Subspace  uh  that
will  behave  like  like  dis  behave  so  it
will  be  training  Norm  it  will  be
contained  in  the  locus
uh  so
uh  is  contained
in  Long  inverse  of
01  and  it
contains  Norm  inverse  of  the  op  of  open
inte
relation  don't  each  other
well  what  one  you  can't  say  contain  and
you  could  even  consider  a  third  version
which  would  be  the  intersection  uh  so
you  can  also  intersect  these  two  uh  and
then  something  that  Dustin  mentioned
last  time  is  that  actually  if  you
intersect  these  two  this  map
becomes
uh  an  embedding
also  so  this  becomes  an  embedding  but
also  this  one  becomes  an  embedding  you
can  also  consider  a  Jo  T
head
guess  um
and  uh  this  is  also  true  here  so  all  of
these  three  things  uh  there  are  some
slightly  different  versions  of  what  what
a  dis  might  be  um  and  there  also
sandwich  between  like  the  over
converging  close  unit  disc  and  the  open
unit
disc
so  in  particular  like  one  way  to  verify
the  item  potency  Without  Really  sort  of
without  doing  any  calculations  is  to  see
that  the  this  da  and  this  npec  with  the
T  gases  are  are  sandwiched  in  between
each  other  in  this  co-  limit  and  then  it
formally  since  for  one  of  the  terms  you
always  have  a  monomorphism  it  follows
for  the  other  term  you  I  mean  there  one
thing  you  really  have  to  check  which  is
this  that  these  two  do  not
intersect  I  think  this  is  the  one  have
to  do  yeah  the  others  I  think  you  like  a
clever  way  to  arrange  the  argument  you
can  avoid  them  but  yeah
yeah  so  so  if  the  radiuses  are  but  if
the  radus  are  the  same  they  always
intersect  any  dis  when  the  disc  R  around
zero  any  version  and  one  around  inity
they  will
inter  okay
for  all  versions  of  the  of  the  story
okay  yeah  I  mean  it  well  it  depends  on
which  base  you're  working  over  okay  but
over  the  universal  base
yeah
um  okay
so  all  right
um  yeah  so  so  let  me  start  by  talking
about  six  funs  um
so  let  me  first  recall  um  uh  that  on
analytic
RS  uh  we  had  first  of  all  we  had  to  fun
that  was  taking  a  to  d  of
a  and  uh  we  also  considered  the
different  function  which  was  to  look  at
uh  presentable  stable  Infinity  line  over
d
uh  um  so  this  uh  was  a  funter  from
uh  from  on
ring
towards  symmetric  monal  inin
categories  so  in
particular
uh  like  the  commu  of  algebra  structure
here  has  insisted  some  T  fun  uh  and
actually  there's  also  always  in  both
cases  they're  close  so  there's  an
internal
home  and  it's  also  functorial  in  the
ring  so
uh  funori  in  the  ring  and  so  this  gives
you  in  particular  for  any  map  of  rings
you  have  a  base  change  functor  which  uh
think  geometrically  is  always  upper  star
and  Joint
star
so  these  are  four  of  the  six  funs  and
then  uh  we  defined  this  class  of  fre
maps  and  for  these  we  had  also  a  fun  of
lower  streak  and  upper
streak
why  does  he  move
discreetly  because  of  the  the  yeah
something  t  one  picture  instead  yeah
another  high  quality
camera  usually  like  you  don't  see  right
exactly  and  so  we  right  um  so  one
convenient  way  to  package  all  this  data
um  is  in  notion  of  an  abstract  seun
formalism  which  um  I  call  the  following
so  uh  whenever  you  see  any
category
category  um  and  E  some  class  of
morphisms
so  let
me  always  assume  that  my  Infinity
category  is  all  finite  limits
perity  um  and  here  is  a  class  of
morphisms  stable  under  composition  and
base
change  where  composition  includes  the
empty  composition  exclude
fors
um
uh  then  we  can
define  a  new  Infinity  category
core
um  where  I  mean  it  takes  a  little  bit  of
effort  to  uh  write  down  the  official
definition  in  terms  of  simplies  but  I
don't  want  to  uh  write  down  something  in
simplies  on  the  board  so
uh  the  object  uh  the  object  to
see  morphisms  were  these  uh  spans  so
morphisms  from  X  to  Y  were  given  by  some
object  W  on  top  where  the  second  n  here
was  an
e
um  uh  the
composition  uh  was  given  by  taking  two
such
guys  and  following  the  fiber
product  so  then  if  you  have  two
morphisms  and  these  are  both  in  e  but
the  compatibility  and  the  base  change
the  base  change  is  an  e  but  then  also
the  composite  is  an  e
and  it's  a  symmetrical
structure
uh  is  the  product  of  varieties
and  there's  an  obvious  way  of  taking  a
product  of  to
morphs
okay
and  then  we  have  this  definition  that
uh  well  first  of  all  three  fun
formalism  where  the  three  funs  here  that
I'm  talking  about  are  T  full  and  a  floor
streak  when  f  is  an
e
um  or
C
is  Le
from  this  correspondence
category  with  it  end  of
product
towards  Infinity  categories  with  Aion
Sol  um  in  PR  I  would  like  right  PRL  here
uh  I  don't  because  in  a  second  I  also
want  to  discuss  this  example  where  these
categories  themselves  they  are  inte  but
they're
not  in  this  version  of  them  is  not  a
presentable  thing  so
um  maybe  for  the  moment  I  don't  need  it
uh  and  there's  a  six  fun
formalism  what  is  the
the  just  cian
product  and  the  means  in  which  direction
there  are  two  ways  like  d  of  x  t
y  right  so  yeah  so  lights  here  means
that  you  only  roughly  speaking  you  only
have  maps  from
d  x  times
Dy  to  T  of  X
for  but  they  need  not  be  equ  they  just
have
maps  and  if  you  apply  this  to  the  empty
product  this  also  means  that
D  of  the  final  object
has  has  a  distinguished  object
um  uh  it  is  a  six  fun  formalism  uh
if  like  the  joints  are
home  the
upper  so  in  LX  is  there  a  condition  on
on  the  on  the
identity
sorry  in  the  notion  of  LX  symmetric
monoid  yeah  is  it  also  a  condition  on  D
of  the
identity  yeah  yeah  so  yeah  you  can  apply
yeah  so  there  also
like  um  from  the  empty  product  here  so
from
the  uh  final  category  so  the  point
there's  a  map  to  the  drive  category  of
uh  uh  the  empty  product  so  P  of  the
empty
set  and  from  there  from  the  empty  set
you  can  go  further  to  anything  else  by  a
pullback  so  some  particular  like  all  the
all  the  you  have  acces  here  are  pointed
which  is  giving  you  the  unit  objects
really
all  for
point  I  think  it's  of  the  empty  it's
sorry  it's  yes  think  it's  than  you
show
all  right  and  so  uh  a  this  is
uh  very  difficult  amount  of  data  that's
it's  not  so  clear  how  to  construct  it
but  conveniently  like  Le  Jen  proved  some
very  difficult  comori  recipe  well  the
recipe  is  extremely  easy  the  proof  that
it  works  is  rather  difficult  um  but  that
uh  makes  it  extremely  easy  in  practice
to  construct  these  things  um  so  in
particular  like
for
C  brings  up  and  E  the  streetable
NS  um  sending  a  either  to  D  of  a  or  to
crl  of
a
um  uh  which  I'll  probably  discuss  in  a
second  because  okay  let  me  just  Dove
this  one  for  now  um  uh  is  an
example
all  right
um  and
so  uh  but  now  this  and  then  some  to  the
category  of  analytics
text  and  we  would  like  to  extend  uh  this
maybe  to  also  some  larger  class  of  fre
Maps  well  not  just  I  mean  the  fre  maps
of  aine  certainly  you  want  also  base
changes  but  maybe  much  more  than  that  um
and
so  uh  yeah  so  here's  the
here  um
there  is  a  minimal  cost  of
morphism  um
unique  um  morms
e
the  following
property  you  mean  there  is  the
smallest  because  any  class  satisfying
the  condition  contains  this  yeah  any  any
other  class  that  satisfies  uh  the
following  properties  will  contain  this
class  yeah  so  unique  minimal  is  slightly
different  in  some  conventions  because  it
means  that  the  POS  it  as  a  as  a  unique
minimal  thing  it  doesn't  mean  that  it  is
the  smallest  because  so  it's  but  this
depends  on  your  your  Notions  but  it's
it's
slightly  According  to  some  definition
better  to  say  smallest  than  unique
minimal  but  because  minimal  doesn't
imply  that  it  is  smallest  in  for  parti
other  sets  unique  minimal  doesn't  imply
it
smallest
um  uh  properties  so
uh  first  of  all  the  the
class  uh  a  class  of  morphisms  of  maps  of
analytic  Rings  Define  Maps  that's
something  we  want
um  also  we  want  that  if  we  have  just  a
disint  union  of  fre  m  recable  so
um  stable  under  unions  in  the  following
sense  so  if  uh  you  have  some
f  from  some  XI  to  some  common  y
uh  all  of
them  then  F  the  dist  Union  of  all  the  F
from  the
over  y  so  from  the  of  all  x
yint
thisable  i  it's  clear  how  you  would
Define  a  l  stre  function  in  this  case  I
mean  the  drive  car  of  the  dist  a  product
and  then  you  just  take  the  direct  sum  of
all  the
streaks
um  it's  this  class  is  local  on  the
target  uh  in  the  following  sense  so  if
if  you
have
uh  the  morphism  of  analytics  text  such
that  the  exist  some  cover
sorry  I  wrote  X  before  so  stick  to
this  um  that  exist  some  y  Prime
subjecting  onto  y  for
which  uh  F  Prime  which  is  a  base  change
of  of
f
uh  which  fime  isn't  class  uh  the
class
say  uh  I'm  not  quite  sure
whether  I  need  to  explicitly  say
it  so  I  definitely  want  this  class  in
the  end  to  be  stable  under  compeition
and  base  change  and  I'm  not  sure  whether
I  should  whether  this  follows  at  some
point
but  always
assumption
um  all  right  so  uh
right  so  this  says  that  to  check  whether
something  is  triable  you  can  uh  localize
on  the  Target  and  by  the  way  I  mean  if
you  wanted  to  find  the  lower  streak
funter  for  such  a  guy  it's  actually
quite  clear  you  would  do  it  because  you
already  have  this  ler  streak  fun  for
this  one  and  you  know  that  streak  fun
they  always  come  with  base  change  so  to
Define  lower  streak  on  y  Prim  on  y  you
can  do  it  after  this  base  change  to  Y
Prime  but  then  all  the  further  base
changes  they  must  uh  I  you  must  get  it
send  data
because
uh  these  L  streak  functors  come  with  Al
base  CH  as
M  uh  all  right  but  now  you  also  want  to
simplify  it  on  the  story  so  you  might
imagine  this  is  just  a  point  but  this  is
some  complicated  arting  s  or  something
like  this  and  then  you  want  to  be  able
to  compute  streak  uh  streak  map  here  by
taking  a  smooth  cover  and  using  the
street  maps  which  you  already  have  in
the  smoth  cover  uh  and  this  is  included
in  the  next  which  is  that  in  the
suitable  sense  is
EAS  Lo  on  the
source  um  so  this  says  that  if  you  have
a  map  from
XY  such
that  there  exists  a  cover
um  next  to  on  to
x
uh  G  here
uh  uh  what  the  following  properties  that
uh  G  already  lies  in  each
other  and  is  of  universal  stre  in  the
sense  that  I  will  explain  in  a
second
uh  and  the  composite  and  uh  and  the
composite
MTH  so  you  should  think  that  this  is
rather  stacky  but  now  you've  covered  it
by  something  more  reasonable  um  for
which  you  already  know  that  the
composite  map  is  is  uh  is
needer  then  the  original  map
license  and  maybe  I  should  make  some
remark
now
um  did  you  say
what  Universal  stre  descent  here  I  mean
stre  descent  after  fullback  to  any  fine
so  because  this  map  already  has  street
maps  you  can  always  ask  whether  the  like
the  r  of  X  Ming  street  maps  to  the  r  ex
and  Al  fiber  prod  an  equivalence  and  I
ask  this  not  only  over  X  but  after  pull
back  to  any
but  Peter  it  doesn't  it  follow  from  the
assumption  that  it's  a  cover  in  the  gr
topology
um  how  do  you  know  is
uh  very  very  true
thanks  thank  you  Dustin
oops
Yeah  what  is  this
now
so  how  do  we  know  that
this  that  how  do  we  know  that  there  is  a
sh  for  those  kind  of  oh  it's  the
assumption  that  g  is  in  this  uh
well  G  is  an
EA  no  if  you  mean  no  no  no  but  EA  we
don't  know  that  there  is  the  theorem  say
there  is  a  minimal  class  and  wait  wait
maybe  maybe  I  need  the  next  condition  to
to  justify  it
um
um  if  you  have  a  m  x  to  Y  is  an
eer  and  why  is  that
fine  then  I  actually  ask  that  you  can
always  find
um  uh  a  cover  of  eggs  by  things  which
are  over  Y  which  I
F  and  fin  then  all  the  fiber  products
are  also
okay
because  and  all
the
also
x
i  is  covering  over  X  and  then  you  need
the  full
simpli  so  if  I  if  I  if  my  base  is  fine
then  I  make  a  strong  restriction  on
anything  that's  possibly  allowed  then  I
always  ask  that  I  can  always  further
find  such  a  shable  I  mean  such  a  yeah
shable  c
um  where  all  the  XIs  themselves  they  lie
in  this  original  class  of  recable
maps  Peter  don't  you  also  need  a  variant
of  four  with  disjoint  unions
like
or  would  this  be  strictly  more  General
like  doesn't  two  say  that  I  could
always  no  but  two  doesn't  say  that  x  i
to  the  Joint  Union  is  in
E  is  in  is  in
e  in  other  words  if  you  want  to
localize  by  using  a  family  instead  of
one  object  and  then  you  need  some
argument  to  reduce  to  the  c  one  object
and  it  seems  convenient  instead  of  two
to  have  also  the  fact  in  addition  I
guess  I  suppose  in  some  places  that  x  i
to  the  of  X  I  like  X  to  X  un  y  probably
it  should  be  in  your  class  because  it's
just  yeah  but  this  is  just  because  it's
locally  in  the
class  X  to  X  Union  y  why  is  it  in  the
class  because  it's  locally  in  the  class
no  but  in  locally  you
assume  okay  okay  okay  okay  okay  okay
okay
just  sorry  and  then  the  empty  to  the
something  is  always  in  the  class
because  because
why  because
it's  why  empty  to  anything  is  in  the
class  may  you  have  to  add  it  no  this
might  e  the  empty
collection  ah  okay  okay
okay  no  the  empty  to  something  X  is
empty  and  then  going  to  Y  this  would  be
in  the  class  yeah  you  can  reduce  to  Y
being  Ain  by  by  yes  and  then  then  it  is
e  then  it  is  in  E  okay  okay  okay  okay
okay
okay  all  right  I  I  hope  I'm  not  scre  up
but
um  uh  right  so  to  you  see  this  Universal
streak  desend  after  pull  back  to  fine
for  such  a  map  then  um  after  pullback  to
fine  you're  in  the  situation  of  this  one
but  then  you  always  know  that  you're  can
refine  by  cover  by  stre  find  for  which
you  know
stre
um
um  and  there's  one  last  condition  which
is  really  one  we're  interested  in  that
um  the  six  fun  or  the  three  fun
formalism  than  you
Neely
uh  from
CE  I  mean  from  analytic  rings  and  one  we
have  to  analytic
STS  uniquely  in
the  space
this  you  have  to  put  it  in  ER  to  the
prev  yeah  so  uh  for  some  of  these  Surs
I'm  implicitly  using  that  uh  I  mean  okay
let  say  that
okay
um
uh  yeah  so  uh  so  this  follows  from
results
uh  from  exra  I  mean  this  has  nothing  to
do  with  a  specific  six  dealm  this  just
an  is  all  about  six
formalisms
uh
and  uh
and  I've  given  some  account  of  this  in
my  notes  on  six
funes  uh  using  Min  different  setup  but
uh  I  think  the  same  argument  works
here
all  right  so  that's  an  extremely
convenient  result
um  because  it  gives  us  this  extremely
structured  formalism  of  six  operations
um  I  mean  actually  whether  I  say  three
or  six  fun  doesn't  really  matter
here  let  me  say  six  because  for  this
these  are  all  presentable  categories  and
the  fun  f  is  all  Co  limit  and  then  as
Dustin  explained  he  always  have  the
right  joints  anyways  um  so  you  have
these  uh  six  funs
now  uh  for  some  classes  of  stacks  and  if
you  want  to  check  whether  uh  and  it's  in
practice  extremely  easy  to  check  whether
any  map
um  has  or  in  practice  basically  all
morphisms  have  three  funs  and  using  some
of  these  criteria  that  you  can  localize
on  S  and  Target  it's  also  usually  rather
easy  to  check  that  this  is  the
case  so  you  can  first  simplify  the
target  as  much  as  you  want  um  by
localizing  and  then  you  just  have  to
find  some  kind  of  presentation  of  your
guy  which  makes  it  simpler
all  right  um  let  me  say  a  few  words
about  how  it's  done  so
uh  kind  of  hard  to  explicitly  describe
but  it's  easy  in  practice  you  can  check
that  the  given  map  belongs  to  this
class  so  let  me  just  give  an  example  to
illustrate  this  little  bit  what
Happ  must  this  must  be  covered  by  but
then  is  it  enough  no  then  you  iterate
you  do  that  again  and  again  and  again
youate  so  then  yeah  you  iterate  working
locally  on  the  source  and  the  Target  and
you  have  to  iterate  and  trans  find
this  I  mean  because  once  you  get  new
shakable  maps  then  working  locally  you
get  new  things  that  can  be  covered  by
those  uh  so  let's  assume  you're  in  a
situation  where  you  have  some  EXC  Y
which  is  where  maybe  the  Y  is  something
simple  just  a  point  and  the  x  is
something  spey  but  then  you  can  find  the
cover  um  where  this  for  where  you
already  have  stre  Maps  here  so  then  uh
the  D  of
X  because  of  the  cover  it's  a  limit  of
the  street  maps  of
like  exer  and  then  all  the
f
but  this  is  also  the  same  thing  as  again
the  co  liit  along  the  lower  stre  funs
now  taking  in
PRL
um
of  of  the  same  of  of
the  so  these  are  the  upper  streak  fun
but  you  have  low  streak  fun  in  the
opposite
direction  and  for  all  of  these  things
you  already  have  uh  lower  stre
funs  and  they  are  compatible  with  the
transition  Maps  uh  and  so  thus  because
it's  a  CO  limit  and  this  guy  is
presentable  all  the  M  preserving  uh  you
get  the  unique  L  stre  fun
here
that's
um
so  uh  let  me  actually  give  uh  even  more
specific  example
um  let's  consider
uh  just  the  interval  mapping  to  a  point
so  this  is  not  something  which  happens
in  condensed  sets  but  as  we  said
condensed  sets  can  be  embedded  into
analytic  stxs
um  uh  as  s  explained  last  time  there  is
this  descendible  cover  uh  of  this  by  a
counter
set  and  this  map  here  this  is  stable
because  when  you
uh  face  change  to  some  cover  here  so  can
check  it  locally  and  if  I  base  change
this  to  the  cont
Set
uh  then  the  fire  product  here  becomes
itself  some  live
profile  cont
um  and  this  map  here  is  just  a  faul  flat
map  I  mean  it  corresponds  to  Facey  flat
map  of  fine  thingss  and  so  this  this
here  is  an  e  so  this  map  here  is  an
EA  um  and  and  also  I  mean  this  map  here
is  already  in
E  and  so  up  pror  in  our  world  we've  only
defined  stre  Maps  here  and  we  didn't
Define  what  the  street  map  would  be  for
for  the  general  compact  House  of  space
um  but  then  turns  out  that  in  fact  at
L
star  and
then
one  can
observe  that  actually  F  noise  3  happens
to  it  also  be  a  FL  Star  as  you  would
actually  expect  because  this  looks  like
a  proper
map  uh  let  me  do  yet  another
example  uh  so  this  way  you  can  I  mean
some  it  automatically  extend  from
profile  sets  to  compact  house  space  at
least  the  five  dimensional
ones  it  also  gives  an  extension  to  all
compact  house  uh  no  let  me  not  say  that
LE  def  find  dimensional  ones
um
uh  uh  but  then  you  also  have  locally
compact  out  of  guys  so  for  example  I
don't  know  you  have  you  have  the
reals  and  now  maybe  this  is  a  point
where  Dustin  said  I  should  have  taken
this  J  somewhere
oh  there  it's  okay
um  so  this  is  covered  by  the  distr  union
over  all  I  don't  know  n  of  like  the
interval  from  minus  n  to
n  and  uh  because  what  why  is  it
subjective
because
uh
yeah  I  me  just  from  the  fun  points  like
I  by  definition  like  as  like  cond  said
this  is  a  union  of  of  these  things
um  so  this  is  definitely  subjective  it's
also  uh  it's
also  again  and  one  way  to  see  this  is
again  to  cover  this
by  uh  well  maybe  Again  by  some  dist
Union  of  Life  Prof  Finance  set  and  then
this  is  a  just  Union  of  close  subset  so
it's  um  and  so  this  is  a  dis  Union  of
things  which  you  already  know  is
thiser  um  so
also  this  guy
here  and  so  now  the  formalism
automatically  gives  you  an  a  flow  stre
fun  for  this  kind  of  locally  compact
House  of  gu  so  I  mean  this  argument  will
generally  work  for  any  kind  of  locally
compact  supp  to  maybe  light  and  five
dimensional
thing  and
uh  so  we  get  some  FL  streak  and  you  can
actually  check  that  it  is  a  usual
stre  you  can
observe  the
comp
and
why
uh  well  I  mean  just  be  I  mean  you  can
look  at  this  definition  here
like  the  drive  category  of  uh  of  R  can
be  written  as  a  Coit  of  the  graph
carries  on  these  minus  n  NS  along  the
lower  street  maps
um  and  then  to  describe  at  low  stre  it
just  it  means  the  col  presing  fun  so
it's  enough  to  describe  what  it  does  on
all  these  things  but  here  it  is  just
chology  which  is  compact  for
chology  and
so  I  don't  know  uh  I  mean  so  this  very
abstract  procedure  actually  recover  it's
a  lot  of  like  upior  geometric  interation
about  what  a  low  fre  function  should  be
of
um  right
uh
yeah
maybe  so  when  I  discuss  the  t  a  look
curve  I  was  mentioning  that  some  should
be  proper  and  that  it  should  be  smooth
let  me  say  a  few  words  about
uh
smoothness  um  um  so  here  is  one  possible
definition  uh  so  those  an  inductive
definition  uh  a
morphism
and
why
um  actually  wanted  to  be  in
the
um  is  and
then  let  me  say  proper  now
uh  maybe  weekly  proper  it's  not  it
doesn't  precisely  match  one  something  I
call  proper  in  the  context  of  an
abstract  let  me  just
say  proper  and  maybe  Dustin  will
complain  that  he  wants  this  for
something  more  specific  um
uh  if  one  of  the  war
H  uh  there's  a  question  in  the  chat
Peter  yeah  it  says  do  we  have  any
explicit  description  of  f  uper  shriek  of
the  unit  object  for  FX  to  a  point  in  the
category  analytics  tax  or  at  least  in
some  special  cases
very  good  question  uh  let  me  refer  to
the  discussion  of  Smooths  coming  up  in
just  a  second  um  so  if  you  for  example
look
at  like  f  low  streak  in  these  examples
here  it  was  just  usual  F  low  streak  and
so  then  the  F  uper  streak  is  also  usual
dualizing  complex  so  in  virtually  any
situation  where  you  already  have  a
dualizing  complex  uh  our  up  streak  will
agree  with  what  you  say  is  dualizing
complexes  um
um  except  like  one  thing  you  have  to  be
careful  about  is  that  if  you  embed
schemes  into  analytic  stats  in  this  way
in  this  kind  of  with  a  tri  analytic  ring
structure  and  all  maps  become  proper  as
we  said  right  and  so  the  f  l  streak  is
always  F  lower  star  and  the  upper  streak
is  then  this  funny  R  joint  of  a  lower
star  that  is  sometimes  considered  but
is  not  so  well  behaved  in  some  ways  um
so  if  you  want  like  the  usual  dualizing
complex  on  a  scheme  of  finite  typ  or
something  like  this  you  should  rather
use  this  other  embedding  using  relative
s  with  this  caveat  I  think  anyways  so
let  me  try  to  describe  find  prop
morphisms
um  so  one  case  that  I  definitely  want  to
be  proper  is  that  it's  relatively
representable  on  F
lines
so  meaning  that  after  you  pull  back  to
any
fine  becomes
fine  uh  repres
FES
uh  uh  sorry  the  following  and
proper  you  want
toor  for  all  Prim
y
y  um  X  Prime  which  is  the  final
product
F  and  X  Prime  to  Y  Prime  is  proper  in
the  sense  that  we  used  before  for  uh  F
so  that  it  has
structure
sorry  Peter  we  we  were  just  discussing  a
remark  that  um  in  the  setting  of  aine
analytics
Stacks  the  prop  you  know  this  the  proper
Maps  satisfied  descent  for  the  gro  and
de
topology  um  uhu  so  what  someone  pointing
out  that  whether  I  say  well  they  don't
right  because  there  have  some
connectivity
issue  uh  right  that's  true  but  I  think  I
pass  once  more  to  diag  or  something  I
can  avoid  this  so  let  me  make  this  so  so
therefore  it's  not  the  same  not  the  same
as  as  so  as  being  locally  no  yeah  we
should  so  we  really  shouldn't  ask  for
all  why  Prime  mapping  to
we  yeah  yeah
yeah  discon
yeah  they  will  be  a  second  part  of  this
definition  I  would  hope  that
um  was  the  second  part  it  wouldn't
matter  what  I  said  here  but  okay  I
didn't  carefully  check  it  so  let  me
maybe
not
however  not  that  one  thing  that
um  this
implies  is
that
uh  if  this  so
happens  uh  in  case  one  then  you  already
know  that  F  stre  has  a  canonical
equivalence  with  f  star  um  that's  given
to  you  because  in  for  these  Maps  we
Define  the  F  stre  to  be  the  F  star  then
because  you  can  Constructors  ISM
locally  d  canonically  uh  get
it  so  basically  the  class  of  program
that's  be  the  one  for  which  a  floor
speak  is  a  floor
St  but  but  say  it  like  this  it's  not  a
condition  uh  but  I  want  to  say  something
which  is  really  just  a  condition  um  and
some  one  way  to  do  this  is  to  oh  yeah
like  for  for  these  guys  here  have  such
an
identification  uh  and  in  general
um  you  can  ask  a
diagonal  Delta  F  from  X
to  x
*
proper  this  is  why  I'm  saying  it's  an
inductive  definition
um  so  this  might  might  be  proper  in  the
sense  of  one  or  it  might  also  be  proper
in  the  sense  of  two  in  which  case  it
pass  the  diagonal  again  then  hope  those
proper
um
and  um  so  once  the  diagonal  is  proper  uh
um  you  get  an  identification  between
Delta  FL  stre  and  Delta  FL
star  um  and  this  allows  you  to  construct
a  canonical  comparison  map  from  a  floor
Street  to  a  floor
Star  as  Maybe  recalling  the  second  where
it  comes  from  and
induced  does  it  follow  after  and
actually  you  might  think  you  want  to
also  ask  this  after  any  base  change  it
actually  follows  and  actually  something
even  weaker  of  FIS  F  said  speak  of  the
unit
unit  and  then  Sol  it  after  the
new  so  does  this  lead  to  a  trans
possibly
transfinite  process  namely  suppose  you
have  you  use  can  can  use  fly  many  times
and  then  you  can  say  no  I  I  want  us  to
to  determinate  to  find  many  things
yeah  there's  no  way  to  get  it  to  go  let
us  say  suppose  that  you  have  a  cover  y
Prime  to
Y  by  half  ah  in  this  case  one  is  one  is
one  is  terminating  condition  and  the
other  is  just  you  can  apply  fin  many
times  but  at  one  point  you  should  run
into  to  one  condition  one  okay  so  the
joint  Union  of  countably  many  guys  XI  to
Yi  which  are  which  are  proper  in  the  in
the  ey  sense  will  not  be  proper  if  when
the  sense  goes  to
Infinity  no  no
sorry  again
this
when  I  said  there  is  a  cover  by  such  I
was  allowing  that  it's  a  cover  by  a
collection  of
such  no  no  no  but  I'm  asking  suppos  XI
to  Yi  is  proper  yeah  then  the  disint
union  of  XI  to  the  disint  union  of  Yi  or
is  not  this  is  also  proper  and  I  think
it  follows  no  because  if  if  you  have  a
sense  one  because  of  ah  because  okay  I
see  what  you're
saying  but  maybe  you  could  just  take
this  as  the  terminating  thing  as  a
definition  but  uh  okay  so  maybe  it's  not
proper  in  my  sense  right  now  okay
yes
okay  what's  the  problem  it's  not  the
problem  there  a  variant  where  you
because  this  is  just  simple  induction
yeah  without  going  to  Omega  yeah  so
suppose  you  have  X  so  yeah  so  maybe  I
should  really  make  this  this  uh  I  should
say  the  proper  is  first  Define  proper
both  both  of  these  things  are  like  qqs
because  I  think  this  should  be  the  case
uh  and  then  in  general  if  it's  true
after  pullback  JY  F  or
something  no  no  because  suppose  you  have
qcq  things  x  i  to  Yi  which  are  proper  in
the  but  in  higher  and  higher  senses  you
need  higher  and  higher  see  take  this
will  not  all  right  but  I'm  not  exactly
sure  in  this  Theory  how  much  you  can
reduce  to  qcq  because  anything  is  a
cover  but  this
yeah  the  the  equivalence  reg  itself  is
not  qqs  in  general  so  it  doesn't  you
don't  have  good  reduction  because  I  the
proper  case  these  things  I  think  should
be  qqs  because  here  the  basic  ones  I  CPS
and  then  the  diagonal  is  and  I  think
from  this  you  can  deduce  that  F  must  be
qu  compa  at  least  because  it  implies
that  the  floor  is  talking  to  schore
limits  um  so  these  things  should  be  qqs
in  a  very  strong  sense  these
maps  all  the  maps  of  q
q  so  in  this  sense  uh  maybe  I  screwed  up
the  definition  I  should  have  given  this
inductive  definition  only  this  qqs  case
and  general  say
locally  sorry
but  thanks  for  the  correction
uh
um  right  so  um  let  me  just  recall  where
this  where  this  is  coming
from  so
uh  let's  look  at  this  diagram  so
then  uh  this  map  giving  such  a  map  is
the  same  thing  as  giving  a  m
from
uh  upper  FL  stre  towards  the  unit  but  F
upper  star  lower  streak  is  by  this
diagram  the  same  thing  as  P2  low  streak
P1  upper
star
um  but  then  can  always
map  uh  towards  uh  T2  L  Street  Delta  F  to
Star
upar
upar  right  I  mean  here  I'm  just  putting
in  the  the  unit  of  this  adjunction  for
Delta  F  in  the  middle
um  uh
but  by  induction  I  have  an  equivalence
between  Delta  and  for  stuff  so  the  same
thing
as  as  this  one  maybe  just  put  the  dial
in
diagram
um  but  then  both  these  Composites  here
they  just  like  P1  up  and  Delta  is  just
the  identity  upar  and  this  is  the
identity  lower  streak  so  this  is  just
the
identity  okay  so  I
can  uh  this  thing  here  is  giving  me  a
natural  transformation  from  F  uper  low
stre  towards  the  identity  then  by  a
junction  and
uh  a  par  sensible  thing  would  be  to  ask
that  this  is  an  isomorphism  of  funs  also
after  any  base
change  but  it  turns  out  by  by  some  funny
diagram  trase  that  actually  if  you  check
it  once  for  the  unit  on  your  guy
itself  then  it's  Asis  funs  and  it's  true
of  Base  change  and  again  this  is
something  you  can  find  in  my  notes  on
six
fun
EX
for
and  so  uh  so  in  particular  with  this
definition  of  what  proper  is  then  yeah
so  then  this  map  here  is  actually
proper  in  this  non  generalized  sense  to
any  careful  however  that  if  you  have
some  kind  of  H  Cube  mapping  to  a  point
then  I'm  not  sure  whether  it's  actually
in
uh  DUS  do  you  know  in  any  case  it's  not
proper  because  there  is  some  the  lower
star  fun  doesn't  actually  con  with  col
because  of  some  infinite
ises
um  right  so  you  can  uh  Define  this
things  and  uh  and  you  can  also  Define
smooth
so  for  smooth  uh  for  smooth  system  I
want  that  the  upper  streak  is  basically
the  same  as  the  paper  star  but  in  this
case  you  don't  actually  usually  expect
isomorph  on  the  nose  you  rather  expect
that  uh  there's  a  same  some  twist  and
also  for  for  smooth  Maps  you  would  never
uh  uh  assume  that  this  is  a  condition
that's  stable  under  passing  two
diagonals
so
uh  um  so  the  definition  of  SMU  is  for
this  reason  is  a  bit
different
and  here  I  us  call  the  things
loic  um  and  this  now  really  matches  the
abstract  thing  defined  for  any  six  fun
form
is  if
um
um  and  now  I  really  want  to  ask  after
there  any
base
sorry  this  CL  maps  on  Bas
change  um  so  there's  the  natural
transformation  from  pullback  Stander
with  f  upper  streak  of  the  unit  what
upper
streak
and  uh  of  unit  which  will  be
some  object  of  X  is  actually  an  inversal
object
tender  and  commute  to  space
change
and  so  I  mean  you  can  form  this  F  upper
spe  to  dualizing  complex  for  x  or  y  but
you  can  also  do  it  for  a  base  change  but
it  should  also  be  an  invertible  object
and  I  ask  that  the  formation  actually
commute  to  space
change  again  you  can  somwhat  reduce  the
amount  of  data  you  actually  have  to
check
um  not
me
um  let  me  rather  just  briefly  say  where
the  center  comes
from  and  so  again  I'm  mapping  to  write  a
joint  fun  so  what  you  try  should  try  to
do  is  in  produce  a  m  from  the
corresponding  L
stre
um  but  then  this  is  precisely  a
projection  form  your
situation  here  pull  back  of  something
and  so  then  this
thing  but  then  uh  it's  just  by  a
junction
so  this  class  is  St  on  the  base  change
uh  composition  I  mean  also  problem  St  in
the  base  change  um  composition
um  it's  in  some  sense  local  on  the
source  if  you  smooth  cover  which  smooth
and  um  okay
so  so  there  are  some  ways  like  that  to
be  able  to  talk  about
um
yeah  some  Notions  of  proper  smooth  maps
and  I  mean  they  some  have  the  expected
consequences  on  the  rough  categories  and
so  you
can  uh  yeah  execute  many  arguments  as
usual  uh  so  I  just  want  to  briefly  now
come  back  to  ttic  curve
again
um
all  right  so  so  a  is  now  again  this
guest
displacer  and  so  now  we  have  the  norm
and  so  we  can  def  find  the  analytic
over  that's  a
of  so  we  have  multiplication  by  two  uh
so  all  right
so
uh  now  we  can  make  some  assertions
um  so  first  of  all  this  St  here  this  is
proper  uh
that's  well  it's  not  representable  in
Fes  clearly  but  the  diagonal
is
uh  because  the  it's  just  a  diagonal  P1  f
um  and  you  can  check  that  p  stre  and  p
star  the  unit  just  agree  and  this  is
actually  just  the  I  don't
know  you  can  check  that  in  algebraic
geometry
um  proper  um  and  it's  also
smooth
come
um  and  for  this  one  should  I  mean
I  you  can  just  really  just  check  that
directly  it's  not  hard  um  you  can  also
do  the  following  argument  that  uh
whenever  you  have  like  the  morphism  of
six  fun  formalisms  so  for  example  like
schemes  mapping  to  analytic
Stacks  then  any  such  morm  of  six  fun
fors  will  always  preserve  comically
smooth
Maps  because  there's  some  kind
diagramatic  way  of  encoding  it  sixun
formalism  um  and  so  the  smoothness  that
you  someh  know  an  algebraic  geometry
automatically  implies
it  the  algebraic  version  implies  anal
question
um  this  J
here  uh  it's  actually  also  I  mean  it's
also
shable  and  it's  actually
somehow  I  mean  I  didn't  Define  it  but  I
could  have  defined  also  in  an  open
imersion
um  so  this  just  means  that
uh  see  identity  and  again  this  is
something  you  can  basically  reduce  to
just  zero  infinity  and  like  the  open  guy
the  close  guy  um  very  some  everything
produces  to  the  usual  six  funs  on
locally  compact  Al
spaces
um  but  uh  so  these  These  are  in
particular  these  are  also
like  J  low  streak  so  J  upper  streak  in
this  case  Al
jerar  particular  is
also
um  so  so  so  this  guy
is  it's  not
proper  just  like  this  I  mean  it's  not  F
compa
inter  okay
um  but  now  again  we  can  take  since  T  the
curve  which  is
quotient  um  ah  but  but  one  thing  that  is
proper  right  so  the  proper  Maps  they
satisfy  the  two  out  of  spe  property
because  they  were  Som  defined  by  passing
and  this  map  here  is  actually
proper  and  so  it  also  follows  that  if
you  pass  to  this  and  GM
then  it's  still
proper  over  zero
Infinity  there's  a  question  in  the  chat
Peter  yeah  are  open  immersions  of
analytics  Stacks  representable
absolutely  not  representable  by  F  I  mean
if  they  were  represent  by  F  in
particular  would  have  to  be  qua  complex
but  this  m  is  very  much  not  quic
complex  so  we  get  much  more  General  open
Emer
um  right  but  now  the  state  litic  curve
um  it's  a  of
analytic
z  um  and  so  thiss
to  Z  Infinity  mod  rescaling  by  po  of  two
which  is  which  is  a
circle  and
so  like  the  base  change  to  Z  infin  you
see  that  this  map  is  actually  proper  but
if  you  project  as  one  to  the  point  this
is  also
proper  um  and  so  you  see  that  the  ttic
curve  is  proper  or  the  point  the  point
is  now  like
a  everything
a  um  so  you  see
that  this  constru  gives  you  an  antic  St
that's
proper  but  also  I  mean  this  map  here  is
locally  split  and  so  this  means  also
this  is  here
Lo  local  is  the  same  as  uh  this  analytic
GM  which  was  smoo  so  also  the  sky  here
isical
smoo
and  I  find  it  a  bit  remarkable  how  you
can  like  combine  intuition  of  about  the
properness  of  compa  spaces  with  some
really  algebraic  geometry  kind  of
properness  and  so  on  and  it  all  works
really
well
and
um  right  so  uh  yeah  also  it  comes  with  a
section  as  a  unit
section  I  given  by  one  and
GM
and
so
uh  so  there  some  of  the  claim
that  uh  this
eqa  curve  which  is  analytic  St  over
a
limit  alun  from
sches  schemes  over  the
underline
nice  ni  essential  image  of  the  fully
faceful  embeding  from  schemes  over  the
underlying  ring  and  ring
ration
uh  so  to  to  execute  this  argument  in  a
really  nice  way
uh  I  should  prove  a  little  bit  more
about  this  ring  a  here  in  particular
classifi  like  the  dualizable  objects  in
D  OFA  that  they  are  just  perfect  complex
which  I  think  is  true  um  let  me  do  it  a
little  bit  more  by  hand  because  it's  fun
um  okay
so  so  here  some  kind  of  General
setup  so  let's  say
a  okay  and  the  X  some  take  over
eight  and  we  want  to
find  and  then  let  me  assume
proper  certainly  necessary  I  want  to
find  some  proper
scheme  and  n  morphism
to  the  anal
notification
and  as  usual  I  mean  the  suggestion  one
can  do  this  in  a  nice  way  is  when  you
have  an  amp  line
bundle  um  so  let's  analyze  it  a  little
bit
so  you
have  line
bundle  L  on  X  with  a  find  properties
such
that  some  T  power  l  or  by  replacing  L  by
T  power  L  itself  L  is  globally
generated
so  there  is  some  X  some  some
n  subjecting  onto  to
L  this  globally
defined
um  for  greater  equal  to  zero  um  if  you
look  at
locally
next  I  don't
know  sorry  this  is  not  an  a  billion
category  because  of  the  derived  all
everything  is  highly  derived  here  so
this  means
that  there  still  well  notion  of  line
bundle  which  means  that  on  FES  it's
locally  it's  automorphic  to  the
structure  sheet  um  and  you  still  have  a
t  structure  on  these  things  right  I  mean
this  also  just  F  this
means  it's  have  structure  and  the
subjective  means  that  the  H  zero  is  of
the  co  is  z  i  yeah
yes  and  for
all  zero  and  bigger  than  zero  uh  there
are  no  higher  there's  no  higher
chology  of  these
guys  and  let's  assume  that  the  h  z  x  the
end  uh  let  me  save  for
some  yes  so  I  think  I  really  just  need
that  it's  the  module  over  the
underlying  mod
next  than  for  for  any  analytic  ring  a
like  the  abstract  modules  over  the
underlying  ring  edul  Faithfully  into  the
complete
modle  and  I  asked  that  it  SL  on  the
essential  image
of  H
me  what  uh  sorry
uh  I  because  it  might  be  derived  Ian  my
in  the  situation  I'm  in  everything
there's  no  derived  structure  so  it
doesn't  really  matter
I  definitely  want  that  there's  noology
and
um  assum  have  this  situation  um  and  it's
not  clear  the  difference  between
Poli  I  mean  this  it's  just  I'm  just
trying  to  say  you  have  an  an  line  bundle
in  some  approximate  sense  so  for  example
I  want  that  it's  Global  it  or  repl  by
some  tens  power  it's  globally  generated
uh  and  there's  no  higher  chology  of  tens
Powers  which  you  can  arrange  and  I  also
want  that  the  global  sections  are  not
something  some  just  to  the  SC  module
because  I  want  an  algebraic  schem  in  the
end  so  then  we  can
define  something  algebraic  to  be  just
the
project  of  the
is  this  AR
GMA  is  it  just  H  zero  or  it  have  a
positive  yeah  I  mean  if  some  X  is
actually  derived  it  could  have  positive
stuff  let's  not  worry  so  much  about
it  so  you  can  Define  this  thing  here  is
a  direct  scheme
over
and  you  automatically  get  a  comparison
that  uh  from  this  algebraic  guy  analytic
fied  and
because  uh
globally  generate  you  can  actually  check
that  this  is  really  a  qu  comp
guy  okay  this  this  is  the
stand
but  it's  not  enough  to  it's
not  L
to  I  hope
so
um
so  uh  so  something  one  can  say  in  the
situation  is
that  uh  so  anything  comes  from  algebraic
geometry  as  we  said  it's  automatically
improper  so  M  actually  automatically
improper
meod  but  also  uh  a  simple  observation  is
that  in  this  abstract
setting  automatically  it  will  be  the
case  that
aest  of  the  unit  is  the
unit  structure  she  is  a  structure
she  um
why  because  you  can  check  this
uh  we  can  check  after  the
pullback  uh
to
f
f
x  of
x  uh  but  there  on  global
sections
because  I'm  the  fine
guy  like  of  CH  is  just  of  the  global
section  because  it's  e
um  uh  but
uh  but  this  inclusion  here  is  really
just  given  by  algebraically  inverting
something  and  so  then  this  a  star  here
is  then  just  some  some  filter  po  Lim  of
inverting  some  function  f  so  this
actually  just  reduces  to  uh  to  to  the
isor  on  sections  that  we
know  I  mean  so  this  is  like  the  plus  of
some  f  where  f  is  some  fun  some  Global
section  of
and
then  uh  you're  really  just
getting  Co
liit  over  multiplication  by  F  of  global
sections  sorry  the
Al  I  mean  either  on  the  algebraic  guy  or
on  the  on  X  but  some  the  AL  guy  was
ripped  so  that  like  the  go  section  of
the  line  bundle  are  the  same  on  X  and
the
albra  what  K
*  the  co  liit  over  K  transition
modication  by  some  section  of
l
f  section  of  L  the  K  or  n  maybe  I  don't
know
uh  F  was  an  unfortunate  Choice  actually
because  that  was  your  map  from  X  oh
sorry  yeah
thanks  thanks
sorry  G  did  I  use
G
let
all  right
so  uh  right  so  you  have  a  proper  map  of
analytics  F  where  FL  St  unit  is  unit  uh
this  actually  implies  that  it's  a  s
active  net  because  like  yeah  this  this
is  a  SE  true  after  any  pullback  because
proper  St  stre  any  pullback  and  so  this
means  that  after  pullback  to  any  Fon  you
can  get  the
algebra  uh  in  terms  of  the  image  and  so
this  actually  means  that  f  is
subjective  all  right  and  so  what  does  it
now  take  to  show  that  F
isomorphism  uh
see  I  mean  this  generality  it  won't
automatic  the  case  that  it's  an
isomorphism  but  um  to  check  that
isomorphism  uh
it  now  suffices  to  show  that  the
diagonal  of  f  is  an
isomorphism  right  because  if  you  have
any  subject  M  of  sheets  it's  Isis  only
diagonal
Isis  uh  but  this
the  diagonal  of  X
here
he  want  just  this  a  pull  back
here  uh  actually  this  also  implies
something  else  I  should  have
said  also  implies  that  the  pullback  map
from  the  garage  category
of  this  guy  is  actually  inly  Faithfully
into  X
because
um  because  if  I  look  at  low  star  upper
star  then  by  the  proection  formula  this
is  just  toring  with  a  star  of  the  unit
C  identity  so  the  unit  of  thejunction  is
equivalent  which  means  fully
faceful  as  it  holds  for  f  but  also  for
any  base  change  of  f  so  in  particular
also  here
um  these  pullback  Maps  here  they  are
fully  faceful  um  and
so  if  it  so  happens
that  there  a  DI
of
X  is
Fon  and  Delta  x
l  of  one  is  in  the
image  of  of  f  *  F
St  discuss  to  show  that  to  give  an
example  of  a  proper  map
explain  the  Cur
algebra  so  I  claim  so  okay  so  I  only
need  to  check  that  uh  this  this  diagram
gives  a  diagonal  commutes  but  in
practice  like  the  diagonal  like  I  don't
know  some  kind  of  complex  or  something
this  this  some  risky  Clos  imersion  in
particular  some  kind  of  f  math  um  and
the  X  Stu  of  one  is  really  just  some
coherent  she
uh  on  on  this  product  and  so  you
definitely
yeah  and  I  claim  that  it's  actually
surprises  to  see  that  this  lies  on  the
image  F
time
uh  um  then  we
win  because  of  it  LIC  image  of  times
upper  star  and  it's
actually  the  same  thing  as  applying  f  f
lower  star  and  then  upper  star  again  um
but  if  you  apply  the  low  stars  and  you
run  through  this  diagram  you  see  that
it's  actually  the  same  thing  as  a
pullback
of  actually  implies  that  it's  equal  to
timeos  of  Del
algebraic
but  then  this  means  that  yeah  but  then
this  means  the  some  of  P
diagram  all  right  so  this  upshot  if  you
want  to  prove  that  some  such  analytic
space  proper  analytic  space  is  algebraic
you  have  to  produce  an  amp  line  bundle
in  that  sense  over  there  then  you
automatically  get  this  kind  of
comparison  M  to  some  uh  algebraic
something  algebraic
uh  and  the  only  thing  that  remains  to
check  is  uh  to  see  that  the  structure
sheet  of  the  diagonal  uh  lies  in  the  the
subcategory  that  comes  from  this
algebraic  and
uh  so  my  time  is  up  but  these  are  things
that  are  simple  to  check  in  the  case  of
stattic  C  so  you  can  for  for  this  L  you
just  take  uh  the  amp  mod  given  by  the
zero
section  and  then  you  can  actually  just
compute  what  all  the  global  sections  are
just  inductively  so  the  global  sections
of  the  structure  sheets  you  can  just
compute  the  AR  easily  and  then  the  rest
you  just  acquire  copies  of  just  the  zero
section  in  addition  which  are  just  your
base  ring  so  this  is  okay  and  well  and
for  the  diagonal  you  can  actually  use
that  this  is  a  group  so  you  can  move  the
diagonal  to  the  Z  zero  section  and  the
zero  section  is
easy
all  right  uh  my  time's  up  to  let  me  stop
here  so  uh  just  uh  I  want  to  clarify
just  from  the  Viewpoint  of  General
scheme  Theory  some  some  point  here  so
you  consider  Pro  of  rings  which  are  not
assumed  to  be  finally  generated  that  us
suppose  that  we  don't  have  a  derived
ring  we  just  have  usual  ring  so  for
example  the  graded  ring  of  H  zero  on
some  scheme  of  powers  of  a  line  bundle
so  we  just  interpret  what  you  said  for
uh  for  normal  schemes  for  Simplicity
because  I'm  not  sure  about  so  now  when
you  look  at  the  notion  of  proper  like
rotend  defines  finite  type  separated
universally  close  but  of  course  you
people  thought  about  the  case  of  nonf  so
you  can  have  a  universally  closed  maybe
separated  but  then  this  turns  out  to  be
projective  limit  in  the  QC  Qs  Cas  a
projective  limit  of  usual  proper  things
so  the  my  question  is  suppose  you  have  a
appr  of  the  type  that  you  consider  so
what  we  know  is  that  it's  covered  by
Finly  many  opens  a  standard  basic
principle  opens
whatever  but  is  it  the  case  that  it  is
proper  well  in  this  universally  closed
sense  so  this  means  that  the  the  problem
is  that  of  course  in  the  T  litic  C  I
think  the  algebra  will  be  fin  gener  but
that  I  allow  the  case  that  the  great
Ring  is  really  just  to  start  with  any
ring  in  degree  zero  and  then  just  repeat
it  what  the  great  thinging  might  just  be
any  ring  you  start  with  degre  zero  and
then  you  just  repeat  it  in  all  the  other
in  in  so  all  all  degrees  are  the  same
ring  and  the  multiplication  and
multiplication  is  multiplication  in  the
ring  and  so  then  then  then  you  just  get
any  F  scheme  in  this  way
wh  wh  why
um  why  you  get  a  pro  no  no  but  this  this
this  uh  ER  this  will  give  you  Pro  of  a
which  is  which
is  no  I  mean  I  mean  I  wanted  to  proper
over  the  right  things  that  is  over  the
AG  zero  I  mean  over  the  the  I  mean  I  I
have  I  have  the  age  I  have
Mak  the  degree  Zero  part  as  small  as  you
like  you  can  okay  you  can  make  the
degree  Zero  part  Z  and  then  the  other
thing  oh  of  course  then  then  then  of
course  it's  not  it's  not  uh  okay  thank
you  okay  but  at  least  in  in  the  Tate
case  I  think  one  one  will  have  also  that
H  zero  is  a  ah  okay  so  so  your  notion  of
proper  so  how  do  you  know  all  qu  contact
qu  separate  def  are  prop  in  your  sense
in  your  sense  ah  in  your  sense  not  in
the  usual  sense  of  okay  okay  so  it's
it's  not  the
usual  but  it's  funny  that  that  usually
Gaga  is  for
proper  for  proper  things  not  for  oh  I
mean  I  mean  this  can  only  work  if
the  thetic  space  here
well  all  schemes  anded  F  Faithfully
inals  St  world  so  there  and  Al  the
career  Chiefs  and  so  on  so  this  there  is
some  kind  of  but  for  some  kind  of  funny
analytic  spaces  but  uh  if  the  X  here  is
some  like  more  usual  kind  of  I  don't
know  comp  space  or  something  exist  and
such  an  algebraization  can  of  course
only  work  if  the  x  is  proper
Z  like  also
you  like  complex  analytic  spaces  they
basically  embed  our  category  and  if  you
specialize  the  notion  of  properness  I
defined  here  in  that  setting  you  get  to
ual  notion  of  properness
oh
okay  because  it  implies  POS
compm
okay
all
right

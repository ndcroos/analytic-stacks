Together with an interpretation of crystals on the q-crystalline site, that we call q-crystals, as modules endowed with some kind of stratification, it allows us to associate a module on the ring of twisted differential operators to any q-crystal. For simplicity, we explain here only the one dimensional case.},

We define Mackey functor objects in the category of Tambara functors augmented to a fixed Tambara functor R_, and we show that the usual square-zero extension gives an equivalence of categories between these Mackey functor objects and ordinary modules over R_. We then describe the natural generalization to Tambara functors of a derivation, building on the intuition that a Tambara functor has products twisted by arbitrary finite G-sets, and we connect this to square-zero extensions in the expected way. Finally, we show that there is an appropriate form of Kähler differentials which satisfy the classical relation that derivations out of R_ are the same as maps out of the Kähler differentials.}

The resulting K-groups are expressed in terms of big Witt vectors of the field. The original proof relied on an understanding of cyclic polytopes in order to determine the genuine equivariant homotopy type of the cyclic bar construction for a suitable monoid. Using the Nikolaus-Scholze framework for topological cyclic homology we achieve the same result using only the homology of said cyclic bar construction, as well as the action of Connes' operator.}

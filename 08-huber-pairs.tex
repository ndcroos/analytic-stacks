e
right  so  last  time  Dustin  started
talking  about  um  like  the  relative  solid
Theory  and  uh  the  relation  to  tic  spaces
and  so  uh  I  want  to  kind  of  continue
with  that  um  okay  so  I  guess  I  want  to
talk  about  the  relation  between  these
basic  objects  that  appear  in  Hub  Ser
that  are  called  hu
pairs
uh  and  the  kind  of  basic  objects  that
appear  in  a
analytic
ring
uh  right  um  so
motivation
uh  but  now  we've  seen  we've  seen  several
examples
of  a
pair  of
um
likeing
a  a  present  notion  of
complete  now  then
same  so  uh  the  first  one  we  discussed
was  the
integers
and  solid  or  should  stress  that  it's
some  one  over  z  uh  solid  beinged  inside
of  all  condenser
beinged  but  then  last  time  Dustin
discussed  the  example  where  you  take  the
polinomial  algebra  over  the  join  T  and
then  within
all  condens  zint
modules  um  well  you  can  somehow  just
take  the  ones  that  are  complete  in  the
sense  of  this  one  so  you  can  to  taking
modules  over  this  uh  algebra  inside
of  solid
groups
uh  but  then  Dustin  argued  that  it's
actually  quite  natural  to
uh  also  isolate  a  stronger  condition
giving  the  solid  C  joint  T  modules  um
which  where  geometrically  speaking  um
well  this  corresponds  maybe  to  some  kind
of  line  and  this  corresponds  to  those
unit  and  all  I  mean  in  these  cases  the
condens  thing  was  actually  just  the  scre
but
uh  this  motion  of  completeness  is  still
interesting  you  could  also  I  don't  know
take  I  know  VP  or  QP  or  whatever  and
then  takes  follow  GP
modules  or  Tak  QP  follow  QP
module
um  and  me  in  those  case  these  are
actually  just  the  ones  that  are  with  the
underlying  condens  group  is
solid  there's  no  me  meanful  way  strs  on
this
um  okay
so  uh  so  notion  of  analytic  ring  exor
this
situation
um
and  uh  on  the  other
hand
uh
um  yeah  on  the  other  if  you  learn  the
sertic  St  um
then  you  uh  run  to  this  definition  I
mean  the  basic  objects  there  are  these
hoirs  so  let  me  recall  what  these  are  um
these
are  ho  although  ho  of  course  use
different  names
um  a  mover
ring  a  topological
ring
um  let  me  also  just  pause  a  now
um  uh  a  that  itms  an  open
sub  a  zero  then
um  such  that  there  exist  some  Finly
generated
idea  and  because  now  it's  not  clear  what
IDE  means  because  there  are  two  ring  in
place  is  an  ideal  for  I
zero
um  uh  subset  a  z  has  the
icy
um  Let  me  give  examples  in  just  a  second
let  me  just  uh  finish  the
definitions
um  and  then  who  this  notion  of  a  ring  of
integral
elements
this  is  an
open  in  a  Hu  ring
a  is  an
open  and  integrally  closed  sub
range
A+  uh  contain  actually  in  the  power  bom
elements
um  second
um
and
third  uh  who  by  par
the  pair
well  a  plus
uh  ho
range
a
anding
okay  so  so  what  are  the  examples  to  keep
in  mind
um  let  me  first  give  some  stupid  example
uh  any  discreet
ring  is  wor
so  in  this  case  you  can  take  a  z  to  be  a
and  t  to  be
z
uh
um  when  ring  that  itself  has  has  the  is
anic  ring  for  fin  generated
DUI  ring
with  the
I  or
some  generated
IDE  so  in  this  case  you  take  a  z  to  B  A
and  I
I  um
and
maybe  like  actually  interesting  is  the
when  have  something  like  B
algebra  um  so  I  don't  know  so  example  QP
is
super  um  or  any  non  field  SCU  and  in
this  case  you  take  a  z  to  be
VP  and  I  generated  by  which  really  is
only  an  ideal  in  zp  and  not  in
C  so
basically  the  idea  is  that  Uber  rings
are  basically  certain  kinds  of
localizations  or  something  exist  of  of
such  AR  rings  with  some  itic
topology
um  and  so  also  whenever  you  have  any
kind  of  boff  algebra  over  QP  or  some
other  nonan  local  Feld  there's  also
always  Uber  Rank  and  as  a  Zer  you  can
some  take  the  unit  ball  in  your  B
algebra  and  as  the  idea  you  can  take  the
one  that  comes  from  a  uniformer  and
you
um
uh  remark  is  that  um  the  completion  of
any  hu  Rings  again
Uber
and  we  will  generally  only  consider
examples  completion  now  in  the  classical
sense  uh  like  allow  all  converging  to
sequences  like  sequen  mod  no
sequen
um  is
again
and  in  fact  if
you  if  you
start
um  with  uh  such  called  R  of  definition
so  one  which  has  the  I  topology  for  some
fin  generated  IDE  ey  uh  then  it  will  be
the  case
that  the  completion  of  a  z  will  be  an
open  suffering  of  the  completion  of  a
and  this  is  actually  just  the  tion
of
and
uh  at  least  when  when  one  uses  hu  R
rings  and  hu  pairs  to  do  addic  spaces
then  the  TIC  spaces  associated  with  a
Hing  and  this  completion  are
definitionally  the  same  um  so  in  this
sense
it's  non-complete  h  rings  have  most  a
technical  role  in  the  whole  the  so
uh  and  we  will  only  consider  complete
once
so  from  the  following  whenever  I  say  h
ring  PA  and  so  on  I  always  assume  that's
the  underlying  H  ring  is
conf  all  right
okay  and  so
uh  here  last  time  Dustin  discussed  some
Notions  of  uh  like  toing  new  elements
power  Bon  elements  and  so  on  uh  this  can
also  be
defined  uh  in  here
so  so  if  you  have  a
uing  um
then
you  can
Define  element  and  power  element  in
a
um  this  is  the  set  of  all  F  and  a  subet
FN  goes  to  zero  and  goes  to
Infinity  which  once  I  assumed  it's
complete  is  really  just  a  condition
right  now
um  and  these  are  all  the
elements  such  that  the  setup  its  powers
uh  it's
bounded  um  it's  actually  problem  to
saying  that  it's  contain  some  such  a
zero  some  such  thing
definition
actually  a  different  way  to  think  about
this  said
uh  um  first  of  all  I  me  you  have  these
canonically  defined  these  are  kind  of
canonical  objects  this  a  St  and  a  double
St  um  but  on  the  other  hand  we  all  these
things  uh  appeared  in  the  definition
that  there  is
some  uh  so  ring  of
definition  uh  and  some  are  here  of
definition  of  same  and  these  will  always
consist  of  elements  and  the  ideal
consist  of  to
elements  all
a  um  we  have  this  so  for
example  example  of
pp  uh  there
zp  is  actually  the  A3  and  the  p  is
actually
the  so  in  this  case  these  kind  of
inclusions  are
uh  equalities  um  of  course  this  can't  in
general  be  true  because  you  could  also
as  ideal  of  definition  here  take  it's
the  ideal  generated  by  p  squ  and  but
then  you  don't  have  all  elements  um  but
in  some  sense  this  as  better  gets  in
fact  the  collection  of  all  such  a  z  and
the  collection  of  all  such  eyes  they
form  filtered  Collections  and  a  is
actually
uh  actually  CL  Co  Li  of  all  possible
such  a
Zer  and  uh  also  I  sorry  and
similarly  uh  these  paic  NE
elements  Al  the  F  exp  of  all
of  defition  Ring  of  definition  of
a  all  right  this  was  part  uh  one  of  the
definition  together  with  a  little  bit  of
discussion  part  two  was
that  oh  no  sorry  there  there  is  no
I  wanted  to  Define  I  wanted  to  say  that
if  I  also  have  a  ring  of  an  elements  and
I  can  define  an  A+  but  it's  kind  of  wake
is
because
sorry
okay  so  uh  when  learn  Ser
exp
um  I  at  first  I  think  it's  extremely
hard  to  appreciate  the  significance  of
this  ring  of  integral  elements  A+  it  is
somewhat  necessary  for  H  to  set  up  a
theory
but  it's  kind  of  hard  to  feel  why  it's
necessary  um
and
uh  and  but  it  actually  turns  out  that  uh
uh  the  series  that  we  develop  using  the
solid  modules  gives  you  a  very  good
understanding  of  what  it  actually  does
Nam
precisely
uh  ma  right  okay  here's  an
example
um
I  actually  several
possible
of  I  just
this  in  this  case  is  just  integr
for  example  you  could  take  just  instead
of
own  or  you  could
take  four
thing  and  in  our  series  sum  uses  and
Associate  to  this  analytic  ring  with  of
modules  it's  some  only  complete  with
respect  to  Z  and  to  this  you  will
associate
um  the
relative  and  so  the  role  that  this  A+
will  play  is  precisely  the  one  of  sing
out  which  modules  to  be  considered  as
some
f  all  right  so  so  maybe  I  should  give
this  definition  of  Analytics  great
uh  oh  by  the  way  um  sorry  maybe  I  can
make  from
notation
um
Hoover  uses  the  single  letter
a  uh  to  the  note  the  ru
pair  consisting  of  some  topological  ring
and  a  ring  of  integral
elements  and  uh  we  will  follow
him
follow
the
uh  so  also  when  I  discuss  analytic  rings
I  want  to  use  single  letters  to  denote
my  analytic  rings  but  then  they  will
have  an  an  underlying  well  condens  ring
that  St  and  we  needed  some  symbol  to
denote  that  underlying  condens  ring  and
we  didn't  come  up  with  anything  good  so
we  chose  to  just  follow  Hoover's
lead  okay  so
uh  let's  say  a  triangle  now  some
lightens  and  then  I  want  to  say  what  is
an  analytic  ring  structure  on  this  thing
so  what  is  an  allowed  class  complete
modules  um  okay  here's  the
definition  it's  equivalent  to  the  one
that  Dustin  gave  in  the  first  lecture
but  presented  from  a  slightly  more
Elementary
perspective
okay
so  it's  a  full  sub
category
um  that  the
modely  ni
um
so  this  is  the  condensed  being
group  and  together  with  a  M  from  T
product
um  the  data  was  just  said  and  now  I  will
make  a  lot  of  conditions  on  this  uh  but
are  those  conditions  uh  that  we  had
already  seen  before  uh  twice  like  twice
we  stated  that  like  solid  groups  and  the
solt  modules  that  they  have  a  lot  of
nice  properties  and  it  was  a  long  long
list  um  and  sometimes  because  we  don't
want  to  save  this  list  all  this  time  we
we  make  this  definition
um  uh  so  first  of  all  to
be  stable  under  kernels  and  Co
kernels  uh  but  it's  also  stable  in  fact
under  all  limits  and
Co  um  all  extensions  so  you  have  an
extension  of  two  complete  C  should  also
be
complete  uh
uh
um  then  there  is  a  Cy  condition  uh
that  you  want  to  check  it's  also  stable
under
all  X  I  from  some
n  x  i  over  triangle  um  where  any
anything
any
um  looking  something  um  and
contains  we  want
the  module
talk  with
something  I  don't  think
so  so  uh  can  I  speak  yes  okay  does  it
imply  maybe  you  can  one  can  prove  from
this  in  some  way  so  for  example  does  it
imply  that  it  is  a  grow  in  the  category
where  the  condition  that  I  allude  to  is
the  existence  of  a  set  of  generators  is
it  automatic  under  these  conditions  yes
yes
yes  did  you  hear  his  answer  over  what  he
said  yes  he  said  yes  yes  ah  this
is  oh  and  does  it  imply  that  the  X
groups  in  the  subcategories  the  same  as
the  X  in  the  full  or  the  oh  no
uh  yes  I  don't  I  don't  know  what  he  said
but  the  answer  is  yes  yeah  I  know  the
answer  is  yes  but  you  didn't  hear  the  I
mean  in  this  presentation  it's  the  drive
completion  might  not  say  in  De  zero  so
if  you  really  phrase  itly  the  bilon
level  you  have  to  be  slightly  careful
when  you  say  that  right  because  it  not
be  the  case  that  like  the  second  I  will
Define  the  derived  C  of  a  modules  and
it's  not  the  derived  C  of
being  it's
not  no  does  he  hear  what  I  say  yes  I
hear  what  you  say  so  you  said  that  the
the  category  yes  so  the  second  I  will
Define  a  certain  triangulated  category
or  stable  in  whatever  um  as  a  full  sub
category  of  condensed  the  of  those
things  yes  which  is  a  correct  one  but  in
general  it  will  not  be  the  same  thing  as
the  drive  category  of  being  cat  don't
say  ah  so  you  in  this  case  you  you  have
a  you  you  in  this  case  when  you  have
this  full  subcategory  you  say  that  you
have  a  derived  category  which  is  not  the
dve  category  of  this
subcategory
yes  this  is  the  heart  of  a  t  structure
ah  this  is  the  those  whose  chromologic
groups  are  in  this  so  it  doesn't  imply
that  the  X  are  the  same  so  it  doesn't
imply  does  not  and  sometimes  it  does
sometimes  it  is  true
but  like  in  most  practical  cases  it  will
end  up  being
true  fullest  generality  no  okay  okay  so
I  can  press  that  yeah
press
um  uh  now  G  put  me
uh  made  me  confused  so  uh  so  I  want  to
claim  that  there  is  automatically  left
the  join  to
inclusion  uh  Dustin  do  I  really
need  need  something  for
this  no  I  think  that's  fine  so  what's
the  argument  again  for  well  I  mean  it's
again  this  General  principle
uh  I  think  it's  not  quite  trivial  but  I
think  it's  a  general  principle  that  if
you  have  a  presentable  category  and  a
subcategory  closed  under  limits  and
sufficiently  filtered  co-  limits  in  this
case  all  filtered  co-  limits  then  um
then  the  inclusion  has  left  the
joint  so  there's  a  very  related
statement  that  involves  this  SE  thetic
nonsense  as  for  p  principle  but  I  think
there  you  don't  have  the  limits  right
yeah  or  no  well  it's  something  or  maybe
you  don't  have  the  sufficiently  filtered
Co  limits  for  something  I  I  believe  the
the  statement  that  I  just  mentioned
which  I  believe  you  also  mentioned  at
some  point  earlier  is  just  a  a  fact  in
zfc
right  if  not  then  just  assume  that  there
is  a  left  to  join  okay  what  is  the  fact
that  there  is  it's  like  if  you  have  a  a
presentable  category  and  then  you  have  a
full  subcategory  closed  under  all  limits
and  under  all  sufficiently  filtered  co-
limits  uh  then  the  inclusion  has  a  left
ad  joint  and  the  category  is  presentable
yes  the  big  Cate  no  the  big  Cate  only
the  big  category  has  to  be  presentable
the  small  one  will  automatically  beat
yeah  but  it  is  not  clear  from  the
stability  that  it  tell  up  the  set  of
generators  no  that's  right  that's  it's
it's  a  non-trivial  claim  yeah  it's  a
non-trivial  claim  which  is  true  in  in
and  what  was  this  I  me  X  implies
something  here  I  think  it  maybe  implies
you  can  leave  out  sufficiently  filtered
Co  limits  or  something  I  don't  quote  me
don't  quote
me
um  right  um  okay  end  of
definition
um  uh
right  so  okay  so  so  so  first  I  want  to
explain  some  general  structures  of  this
um  so  uh  first  on  the  idea  level  so  the
claim  is
that
uh  the  exess  left
includ
that  I  will  write  as  uh  sending  module  m
to  the  base  change  from  a  triangle  to
a
um
uh  so  so  mod  a  right  now  is  just  purely
notationally  but  I  will  think  of  it  as
the  modules  over  this  analytic  rinking
that  I  call  a  um  and  so  uh  it's  such  a
basic  s  function
uh  the
kernel  of  this  fun  the  T
ideal
and  mod  a
requires  a  unique  symmetric
structure
making  that's  a  base
thing
um  all  right  uh  let's  sketch  the  proof
um  so  we  already  discussed  the  question
of  the  assistance  of  the  left  joint  you
think  it's  formal  nonsense  if  it's  not
then  just  make  it  part  of  the  definition
okay  um  now  the  question  is  about  that
this  is  a  t  IDE  so  what  does  it  mean  to
be  T  you  so  so  s  joint  F  it's  definitely
this  all
coits
um  uh  so  to  show  the  T  you  have  to  show
that  if  I  have  something  in  the  kernel
and  the  t  is  anything  then  it's  still  in
the  kernel  so
assume  a  module  a  triangle  module
suang  meaning  it  has  no  maps  to  any  a
module
any  um  then  we  want  to
show  um  I
take  the  s
zero  uh  this  means  set  for
all  mod
a
um  so
home  from
aner
standard  zero  because  this  what  this  fun
by  definition  left  joint  um  but  now
using  home  in  Junction  this  here  also
the
H
uh
from  from
M  into  the
internal  uh  from  n  to  l
but  we  assume
that  this  guy  is  still  complete  by
assumption  this  was  one  of  this
assumption  that  was  stable  under  all  all
internal  likes  in  particular  internal
homes
uh  but  now  this  is  mod  a  then  again
because  I  mean  this  precisely  the
condition  right  also
right  only  mod
a  only  base
stange  but  this
guy
uh
uh  structure  so
uh  uh  so  the  cender  product  on
a  has  to
be  given
by  uh  taking  the  send  of
product  and
uh  of  see  this  as  cond  in  modules  and
then  completing
again  uh  the  question  is  whether  this
uh  this  makes  a  fun  of  symmetrical  um
and  uh  again  so  to
check  uh  for  all  m
andn
I
can  first
tendler  and
then  uh  or  I  can
first  keep  both  of
them
um  WR  this  a  s  product  where  this  was  by
definition  okay  now  it  looks  really  ugly
um  but  okay  only  only  at  the  very
beginning  when  you  first  set  up  the
series  to
disambiguate  all  these
things
um  but  the  point  is  just  that
uh
um  this  fun  here  uh  uh  this  localization
about
the  kernel  of  this  is  a  t  IDE  and
so
um
right  I  think  you  don't  use  the  kernel
but  you  just  repeat  the  same  time  of  the
type  of  argument  homing  this  to  to
Something  in  the  in  the  subcategory  and
and  using  intern  I  did  this  in  the  solid
case  and  you  just  same  argument
same  let  me  not  try  to  do  this
again  Yes  actually  uh  I  realized  that  on
the  level  the  better  thing  to  say  would
have  been  that  if  I  have  a  map  which  is
turned  into  an  isomorphism  under
a  under  under  this  localization  then
also  if  I  tender  this  map  with  anything
else  it  also  becomes  an  isomorphism  and
then  the  which  follows  from  the  same
argument  as  as  as  this  one  really  um  and
then  the  point  is  that  for  example  f  is
from  M  to  its
completion  which  becomes  an  item  of
localization  because  animportant
operation  and  so  if  I  T  this
within  some  the  same  stage
it
so
so  this  is  some  structure  you
automatically  have  antic  range  C  of
modules  some  kind  of  localization  of
condens  the  underlying  ring  and  requires
in  terms  of  product
um  and  now  we  pass
d
let  not  just  say  that  a
structure  on  an  underlying  lightens
string  a
triangle
um  then  undine  the  of  a  modules
uh  the  full  sub  subset  for
all  Z
uh  of  all  let  me  still  just  call  them
n  so  compx  of  modules  um  so
group  let  me  think
homologically
um  uh  all  the  homo
groups  line
Define  for
Jesus
and  okay  so  here  here  here's  already  the
warning  so  there  is  a  natural  comparison
function  from
the  of  mod
a  but  it's  not
always
and  in  essentially  all  I  mean  basically
yeah  all  Cas  I'm  aware  it  will  come  out
to  be  an  equivalence  uh  but  it's  just
not  a  general  effect
um
uh  but  yeah  so  the  good  thing  we  are  to
focus  on  is  the  thing  that  we  simply
call
D  and  so  the  previous  proposition
has  an  analog  on
dou
um
so  e  of
a
triangle
triang  so  I  mean  probably  in  one  or  two
lectures  we  will  probably  switch  to  the
infinity  categorical
language  um  where  we  would  say  stable
Infinity  category  instead  uh  for  now
it's  not  really  requir  so  let  me  just  TR
more  classical  terms
um  uh  stable  under  all  so  again  in
stable  Infinity  case  we  could  say  stable
under  all  limits  and  Co  limits  but
General  limits  and  Co  limits  are  not
well  behaved  work  Str  categories  but  you
can  say  something  equol  and  stable
under  all  s  and  for
product
um  which  are  well  behaved  to  what
they're  supposed  to  do
um
uh  I'm  trying  to
say
um  right  um
the
inclusion  again  has  left
on  um  that  I  will
call  the  dve  S  the
product
and  again  this  has  a  property  that  if
you  have  something  it  becomes  an
isomorphism  here  then  if  you  T  it  with
anything  else  it's  still  the  same  and
because  this  is  now  a  triang  c  you  can
actually  phrase  this  equ  in  terms  of  the
co  so  if  you  have  something  in  the
kernel  of  this  uh  then  you  tend  up  with
something  sa
the
and  then  again  this  the  T
here
so  if  if  one  wants  to  to  do  the  previous
type  of  argument  for  this  fact  then  uh
one  lends  into  the  question  of  whether
the  of  course  there  is  internal  or  in
the  full  derive  category  by  unbounded
and  so  on  but  is  the  question  is  whether
if  you  have  internal  oh  from  anything  to
Something  in  D  of  a  then  it  lies  in  D  of
a  right  and  this  is  not  because  of
unboundedness  I  don't  of  course  you  have
a  bounded  complex  you  have  a  a  spectral
sequence  I  mean  you  still  have  to  to  to
work  with  that  here  you  have  unbounding
in  both  directions  I  can  see  in  One
Direction  you  have
IND  light  conding  is  still  repete  so  the
drive  category  is  left  complete  and  so  I
think  you  can
control  control  the
question  okay  let  let  me  do  this  in  a
second  when  I  come  to  the
pro  uh  s  the
product
maying  face
Chang
all  right
um
uh  yeah  so  so  first  of  all  triangulator
um
so  see  you
have  I  don't  know  M  Prime  to  m  m
Prime  M  Prime  One
Prime  and  there  a
modules  and  let's  assume  two  of  them  and
by  shifting  it  doesn't  matter  which  to
uh  R\&D  of
a  then  we  want  to  show  that  m  is
also  to
show  but  for  this  we  just  look  at  long
sequence  so  we  have
hm  Prime  have
H
and  these  are
a  so  if  I  uh  have  some  quent  here
uh  and  have  some  Cur
kernel  right  and  this  is  a  kernel  of  the
thing  which  a  mod  is  a  qu  of  a  modules
so  this  of  both  a  modules  and  then  this
one  is  an  extension
right
here  we  use  stability  on  the  kernels  and
cions  and  then  we  use  stability  on
extends
no  I  think  standing  here  actually
realize  okay
so
uh
and  the  directed  to  the
H  uh  and  not  standing  realize  that
possibility  the  product  uh  countable
ones  they  definitely  reduce  to
H
uh  and  then  the  uncontable  ones  that  was
okay  when  back  when  we  were  working  the
full  condens  setting  uh  and  preparing
the  lecture  I  overlooked  that  there
might  be  an  argument  to  do  here
Dustin  should  I  just  assume  that  there
is  a  leage  on  the  level  of  the
categories  or  I'm  sorry  I  was  busy  with
the  chat  what  what's  going
on  why  is  it  stable  under  all  products
why  is  what  stable  under  all  products
the  sub  of  complete  ones  oh  oh  all
products  oh  instead  of  just  countable
products  right
oh
ooh  oh  all  prod  all  products  exist  but
is  it  exact  in  your  category  yeah  this
is  problem  problem  like  lightens  all
products  are  not
exact  yeah  this  is  a
problem  okay  we'll  have  to  think  about
this  uh  chip  chip
chip  not  an  actual  issue  in  some  sense
but  I  screwed  up  to  definition  so  we
should
ask  for  the  existence  of  left  the
Z  I  mean  Dustin  did  in  the  first  lecture
and  I  just  threw  it  up  when  I  prepar  to
a  lecture
uh  uh  for  existance  of  left
joint
inclusion  uh  the  definition
of
I  definitely  once  he  admitt  left  the
Jo
call
um
sorry
uh  all
right  um  so  now  I  made  this  next  thing
actually  part  of  definition  that  exist
uh  so
Cur  so  let's  say
m  uh  is  uh  it's  complete  and
then  is  any
con  um  no  sorry  uh  what  I  want  to  show
n  isn't
the  and  then  there  anything
um  then  you  have  to
show  that  for  all  the  on  are
complete
um
Ander
and
uh
and  first  of  all
because  uh  light
set  what's  known  as  a
repat  this  means  it's
countable  limits  of  s  or
subjections
uh  notion  that  was  introduced  in  my
paper  the  SW  but  on  the  pro  side  um  and
one  thing  we  saw  there  is  that  this
implies  that  uh  any
such  any  say  sorry  for  all  I  don't  know
I  didn't  use  the  letter  K  right  so  for
any  K  which  is  for  example  condensed  a
triangle  module  um  k  isomorphically  to
the  derived
limit  of  its  trations  in  degrees  at
North
End  some  kind  of  of
liit  usual  us  being  groups  I  mean  it's
somewhat  true  right  I  mean  when  you
truncate  up  to  some  degree  and  then  just
well  take  a  limit  of  these  things  you're
some  stabilizing  to  the  correct  answer
in  general  that's  so  an  issue  because
you're  taking
accountable  limit  here  in  general
accountable  limits  NY  thing  but  under
this  assumption  you  can  control
them
um  so  this  means  that  I  can  certainly
assume  that  L  is  bounded
here
right  what  I
need
so  first  of  all
um  and  to  show  this  I  can  again  use
tender  H  Junction  and  uh  I  assume  that  M
has  Ser  completion  so  it's  enough
suffice  is  to  show  that  the
internal  and  condense  a  triangle  modules
from
and  sorry  it's  not
CLE  because  then  you  can  rewrite  this  as
a  h  from  L  into  this  guy  but  I  assume
that  M  has  trival  completion  so  it
doesn't  have  to  anything
D  okay  so  this  I  want  to  reduce  to  theb
level  where  I  kind  of  had  the  statement
that  I  something  in  mod  and  some
anything  then  all  the  internal
on  mod  a  the  issue  though  as  already
pointed  out  is  that  here  we  need  to  ask
this  condition  for  all  possibly
unbounded  complexes  uh  that's  why  I
mentioned  this  fact  so  this  at  least
allows  us  to  assume  that
L
uh  here  is
um  so  so  can
assume  L
and
D  minus  or
I  people
put  this  goes  to  the
right  um  because  also  Al  trations  they
are  still  in  D  OFA  but  because  the
condition  was  just  on
the  um  on  the  other  hand  n  can  be
written  as  a  CO  limit  uh  of  the
transations  to  the  left  I  mean  this  is
always  true  that  there  a  CO  limit
ofation
and  less  equal  to
then  this  much
easier  because  Co  limits  for  Ed  to
direct  sues  are  always  good  um  and  some
some  similar  you  can  pull  the  co  out
into  a  limit  and  because  we  know  that
this  is  stable  at  least  under
accountable
products  all  of  them  I  can  also  see  that
n  is
minus  but  I  say  now  I'm  in  business
because  once  this  is  goes  to  the  left
and  and  this  goes  to  the  right
everything  we  usces  kind  of  to  uh
X
um
okay
sequence  L  just
being  uh  Z  and  also  n
the
condition  it's  the  internal
X
okay  I  think  that's
fine  and  once  you  have
that  uh  the  existence  of  the  tender
product  is  just  the  same  formal  diagram
chase  that  I  didn't  execute  just
previously  but  did
solid
all  right  so  another  thing  I  should  have
really  mentioned  as  part  of  the  general
thing  but  didn't  and  so  let
me  now  is  that
uh  Mr  Ro  tender  product
ah
sorry
uh  yeah  so  uh  the  D  of  a  has  a  natural
key
structure  so  making  T  EX
and  uh  the  the  left  is  not  General  exct
as  we've  already  seen  the  solid  base
where
solidification  could  turn  something  to
the  left  but  if  uh  but
still  uh  this  the  face
change  it
preserve  connector
part
structure  uh  T
structure  uh  is  that  you  have  a  notion
of  like  things
which  uh  have  a  notion  of  truncation  of
complexes  kind  of  so  you  have  a  notion
of  like
ration  complexes
which  certain  non-  negative  degrees
complex  which  certain  nonpositive
degrees  they  satisfy  all  the  usual
properties
um  we  definitionally  made  this  triang
sub  which  is  stable  under  all  different
right
so
um  so  this  inclusion  is  T  exact  and  then
it's  just  a  completely  general  fact  that
if  you  have  left  joint  to  T  exact
function  at  least  it  preserves  the
connected
part
um  let  me  do
it  check  whether  this  map  to  anything
which  is  on  concentrated  on  the  right
but  this  is  a  left  joint  so  you  can
compute
the  uh  Mor  pH
in  in  the  larger  category  but  then  this
is  still  in  this
category  um  right  and
so  uh
so  in  particular  you  can  talk  about  the
heart  and  the  Heart  All  is  also
definitionally  is  just
a
and
uh
so  if  you  take  this  and  to  to  the  heart
this  is
uh  this  thing  and  if  you  take  the  temper
product  and  pass  to  the
heart  so  in  this  sense  the  Der  and  the  V
level  are  compatible  and  then  there's
the  other  question  whether  if  you  start
here  and  just  animate  all  these
construction  to  R  category  um  whether  we
recover  those  but  this  is  just  not  true
in  general  yeah  so  in  general  you  don't
even  recover  DFA  but  even  if  you  do
there  are  separate  questions  where  you
Rec  recover  the  correct  function  and
again  not
General  Al  uh  I  think  if  you  do  recover
the  correct  categories  Ed  on  also  the
correct  one  just  by  function  reality
of
but  the  t  produ  is  a
sub  but  again  in
practice  it  is  true
yeah  the  C  of  a  is  just  the  C  and  all
these  funs  are
all
right  uh  with  that  out  of  the  way  I'm
almost  done  with  my  lecture
unfortunately
um
so
okay  the  back  uh  to  the
comparison  um  so  when  we  had  hoing  we
had  these  topolog  new  elements  power  and
so  on  um  and  Dustin  already  gave  a
variant  of  this  uh  first  of  all  H  Rings
himself  or  hubber  rings  and  car
um  the  m  to  condens  rings  of  course
all  this  is  actually  fully  faceful  yeah
all  all  my  ones  are  complete
um  uh  but
actually  uh  this  L  and
Sol
I
uh  on  where  the
underline
solid  um
right  maybe  I  should  call  this
not  uh  right  and  so  then  DUS  already
last  time  gave  a  definition  that  uh  a
trial  a  solid
ring
we  can
Define  subsets  A3  and
A3  of  the  underlying
R  where  let  me
recognition  A3  was  set  up  both
elements
uh
in  the  underlying  ring  such  that  the
corresponding
map
t  uh
to
Triangle  factor
I  um  there  was  some  discussion  about  how
much  structure  do  you  need  to  check  here
um  and  so  the  condition  was  that  it
factors  as  condensed  Rings  it's  actually
enough  to  check  that  it  factors  as
condensed  modules  over  this  this  one  uh
and  then  saying  that  there  is  a  sequence
no  sequence  one  f  f  s  and  so  on  up  to
zero  uh  but  together  with  small
condition  that  F  time  the  sequence  of
shift  of  the  sequence  make
it
okay  and  so
uh  if  you  apply  this  to  the  case  where
this  Sol  ring  AR  arose  from  a  Hu  ring
then  this  is  precisely  the  set  of
to
and
um  elements  those  def  to
elements
such  when  you  regard  AER  as  a  z
display  the  same  way  that  actually
becomes  and  again  you  can  show  that  this
is  precisely  the  same  thing  as  h
conion  of  being  power  um  and  so
then  uh  Dustin  show  last  time  that  this
is  always  an  integral
St
and  this  here  is  always
an  what's  the
definition  uh  yeah  sorry  I  mean  given  f
i  can
again
let  me  write
again  why  this  me  I  can  as  a  and  then
the  condition
is  I'm  already  speaking  some  of  modules
over  see  modules  over  the  Clos  unit  disc
some  motivated  last  time  um  some  this
means  that
should  be  at  most  one  so  should
be  also
check  okay  but  now
uh  I  can  also  make  the  point  so
assume  a  is  an  analytic  ring  structure
on  a  solid
r  a  triangle  then  I  can  also  Define  an
A+  I  realized  I  didn't  didn't  find  any
so  let  me  do  this  in  just  a  second
um  such  set  the  map  from  d  t  a  same  as
always  steps
um
um  this  map  uh  in  use  of  a  map  of
analytic
r
uh  from  V
solid  corresponding  solid  modules
um  yeah  6
precis  so  something  that  I  should  have
said  previously  uh  but
forgot
what  which  is
pair  L
strings  um  and  of  modules  to  some  V
which  similarly  is
aens  of
modules  is  a
m
of  condens
rings  which  has  a  property  that  if  you
use  this  to  restrict  the  condensed  B
modu  to  condens  a  module  uh
then  module  say
complete  restriction  of  s
here  and  here  you  have  the  a
module
uh
and  in  this  case  you  can  pass  the  left
the
joints  on  level  the  same  stat  on  level
of  the  right  cator  because  they  can
check  it  on  the  level  of
mod
and  once  you  pass  left  joints  left  joint
to  restrictions  of  scalers  left  joint
here  is  what  I  term  the  base  change
functor  uh  and  so  you  get  it  also  left
joint
here  which
is
and  if  you  want  you  can  compute  it  by
first  base  changing  as  condensed  modules
and  then  complete
it  and  you  also  get  a  deriv
t
okay  so  the  claim  is  that  uh  first  of
all  once  you  have  such  anru  can  get  data
as  in  Uber  um  and  so  I  will  immediately
check  that  this  actually  automatically
satisfies  this  list  of  conditions  that
Uber  puts  on  this  re  integ  elements
um
uh
conversely  I  not  sure  if  I  have  time  I
hope  I  can  say  it  is  whenever  you  have  a
ring  of  integral  elements  uh  in  h  Theory
you  can  actually  produce  an  analytic
ring  which  some  of  the  initial  one  in
some  sense  um  okay
so  uh  right  so  first  of  all  I  can  also
rewrite  this  the  Smalling  conditions
it's  all  those
things  such
that  1  -  s
*  which  is  an
endomorphism  uh  from  the  d  f
change  from  so  P  was  this  so  P  call  is
always  a  spech  based  on  the  nor
signal
and  we
characterized  being  solid  over  z  t  by
well  being  solid  but  this  we  already
asked  and  that  oneus  t
*  morphism  on  this  projective  generator
so  uh  what's  actually  to  ask  is  that  if
I  look  at  this  thing  here
uh  an  object  in  G  of  a  then  this  is  an
why  so  uh  if  if  if  I  admit  such  a  map
then  this  already  happens  here  like
already  here  oneus  D  time  shift
becomes  uh  autm  of  this  object  like
definitionally  but  on  the  other  hand
because  this  precisely  characterize  the
solid  modules  here  uh  you  can  also  show
the  Congress  like  if  I  want  to  show  that
I  have  such  I  need  to  show  that  all
complete  mod  here  restrict  the  complete
modules  here  but  being  complete
precisely  meant  that  if  i  h  oneus  t  time
shift  into  there  becomes  an  nice  moris
and  so  just
transl
so  basically  we  we  like  whenever  you
have  any  element  of  your  underlying  ring
uh  you  can  ask  this  condition  that  one  F
time  shift  become  morphism  of  p  and  this
will  defin  for  you  analytic  ring
structure  by
General  yeah  basically  whenever  you  have
an  endomorphism  of  your  comple  project
object  p  uh  declaring  that  this  should
be  an  as  from  all  exptic  structure  so
you  can  take  any  any  subset  up  of  this
ring  and  ask  this  type  of
conditions
uh  so  I  want  to  ask  a  question  I  just
asked  DUS  but  it's  not  completely  clear
so  since  you  define  the  notion  of  M  of
analytic  just  in  terms  of  moduls  so  if
you  do  this  you  instead  of  just  the
derived  tensor  L  you  send  to  so  this  P
tensor  l  means  that  you  take  the  tensor
product  and  you  apply  the  left  agent  in
the  derived  sense  but  you  can  just  take
the  tensor  product  and  apply  the  left
agent  on
modules  H  and  that  so  this  is  what  do
this  means  P1  Za  without  the  L  I  suppose
but  then  so  to  check  this  condition  you
get  what  I  said  so  if  you  you  try  to  to
check  the  the  induc  analytic  ring  you
can  translit  to  this  kind  of  statement
but  with  this  Factor  on
modules  but  then  probably  it's
equivalent  to  what  you  have  written  if
you  think  about  it  but  in  the  derived
way  but  I  just  want  to  confirm  that  the
two  versions  are  equivalent  the  one  yes
right  because  you  can  actually  detect
analytic  R  structures  on  the  level  of
modules  it's  enough  to  check  it  on  the
underlying  uh  on  the  indan
level  that  is  also  true  yeah  okay  so
it's  equivalent  it's  equivalent  it
seems
um  I'm  smaller
uh  yeah  so  with  with  a  drive  on  I  would
be  more  confident  but  I  think  the
argument  just  sketched  this  all  through
so  here
um  uh
right  so  the  point  is  that  uh  this
satisfies  basically  all  the  this  this
subset  Al  automatically  uh  satisfies  the
conditions  of  so  it's  always  uh  contains
the  toping  new  Els  which  are  always  an
open  subset  Uber  Series  in  particular
this  open  when  where  it  comes  from  hu  um
it's  always  containing  the  power  bonded
elements  and  it's  always  an  integral  to
St
ring
it's
um  so  why  is  that
so  well  f  is  an
A3  then  we  actually  get  a  power  series
T
about
um  that's
almost
yeah  if  I  have  a
module  that's  actually  Z  power  series  T
modu  in  Solid
V  that's
automatically  Peter  actually  I  mean  this
proof  is  just  exactly  the
same  as  yes  exactly  the  same  as  last
time  me  just  because  all  I  used  was
arguments  about  modules  being  solid  over
one  implying  they're  solid  over  another
and  so  on  yes  let  me  just  St  again  uh
okay
um  so  okay  so  these  are  actually  all
there  but  this  means  that  whenever  I
have
a  a  module  here  over  over  a  so  in
particular  becomes  a  modu  here  which  is
everything  was  solid  so  it  must  be  an
underlying  solid  braing
um
uh  and  so  it  must  be  Sol  with
uh
I
should
um  if  a
plus  then  I  get  a  map  from  here  joint
solid  to
a  um  but  in  particular  this  means
that  a  the  under  condensing  which  we
always  assume  is  a  complete  module  uh
by  restri
becy  so  f  is  an
a
um  right  so  this  this  group  seeing
inclusions  up
there
o
and  uh  there  for
suffing  that's  the  same
argument  so  in  fact  yeah  so  the  argument
that  Dustin  gave  there  was  already
talking  in  something  not  just  about  a
triangle  but  about  any  module  uh  and  so
if  you  just  run  his  argument  to  see  if
this  what  he
actually
um  okay
so
right
th  for  Hing  a
triangle  I  have  the  solid  anal
stru  solid  instruct  one  which  lives  over
solid
Z  and
Uber  uh  consider  this  motion  of  the
Rings  of
integral
and  I  just  gave  you  a  recipe  here  that
was  taking  some  such  analytic  bring
structure  here  and  produced  a  ring  of
inte  elements  A+  in
here
and  it's  actually  functorial  so  you  can
actually  show
that  one  rror  is  contained  of
the  yeah  I  mean  if  you  haveing  and  you
get  an  inclusion  of
the  and  uh  this  actually  has
a  left  joint  I  assume
um  so  whenever  I  have  a  ring  of  so  I  can
produce  and  musicing
stru
solid  s
yes  so  solid
admits  and  necessary  Heat
uh  from  the
solid  solid
is  I  mean  it's  Unique  because  the  M  of
rings  is  unique  and  then  it's  just  a
condition  it's  just  a  condition  that  all
the  a  modules  are  actually
Sol
um  and  the  different  way  to  phrase  this
is  to  ask  that  1  minus
fifth  as  an  anamorphism  of  key
10
a
on  doesn't  matter
um
uh  all  right  so  I  I  wanted  to  say  that
it  has  left  design  uh
so  if  I  have  a  move  up
PA
then  I  can  send  this
toing
a
asso  where  mod
a  by  definition  all  those  condens
modules  the  underlying
ring
sub  for  f  and
A+  when  I  take  internal  home  from  P
into
F1  minus  F  shift  acting  on
that  and
is
and  because  some  of  this  such  a  classes
are  all  is  integrally  closed  it's
actually  enough  to  ask  for  some  kind  of
generating  set  whenever  you  have  a
subset  of  A+  that  generates  it  as  an
open  sub  ring  inte  elements  then  it's
enough  to  checked  for  the  subset  so
usually  there's  just  one  or  two  elements
something  where  really  have  to
check
Al  the  same  thing  as  those  modules
and  only  for  those  two  elements
uh
uh  so  yeah  so  to  connect  spe  to  the
beginning  so  for  example  like  Z  Comm  Z
pair  this  just  follow  Z  modules  um  if  I
take  Z
uh  that's  the
pair  so  if  I  only  put  Z  here  then  I'm
only  asking  that  some  solid  over  Z  so  I
take  all  T  modules  and  solid  Z  modules
but  then  when  I
take  then  this  becomes  Ro
for  and  then  of  time  so  let  me  just
State  one  last
proposition
so  when  you  start  with
h
um  and  then  go
to
uh  then  if  I  go  back  then  this  actually
match  back  to

um  so  if  I  right  so  I  have  an  analytic
ring  and  then  I  can  take
its  so  I  can  take  this  this  thing  here
and  take  its  plus  ring  so  this  is
actually  a  plus
equivalently  the  left  fun
flyable
um  from
who  thank
so  all  brings  but  they
all  and  yeah  I  mean  really  still  quite
struck  by  how  how  closely  uh  the  series
that  solid  antic  Rings  really  matches
hub's  classical  theories  if  you  restrict
to  antic  Rings  where  you  only  ask  allow
yourself  to  put  conditions  that  one
minus  some  element  shift  operator  on  T
becomes  an
isomorphism  then  you're  precisely
getting  those  analytic  ring  structures
that  are  induced  by  rings  of  integral  El
in  h  sense  so  which  is  kind  of  very
strong  a  poster  motivation  for  for  for
this  definition
of  all  right  I  should
stop

things that maybe I should have been
emphasizing before launching into this
whole discussion is that over the
completed Z Theory you you basically you
can do algebraic
geometry
um and then that then that means you can
do algebraic geometry over any analytic
ring just by just by base change so
that's um so that's kind of like
considering the apine line like I was
considering the apine line for example
over an ariary base ring it's not it's
not analytify yet but when you have
extra structure on your analytic ring
then that uh then that picks out a
choice of what it means to analytify
also in algebraic
variety um and
so
uh and I'm also conf exit are fine or
yeah when I was describing kind of
explicitly what it is I was looking at
the case where X is apine but in general
both things glue and so you then then
you can Define uh you can doesn't need
to be it doesn't need to be Aline no
yeah
um so so all the all classical Gaga
theorems
uh are special
cases so
there's um so for example groen's formal
Gaga well the complex analytic
Gaga um so Sarah's original Gaga um take
for example C gaseous or P liquid or
whatever you
like
um uh there's also formal
Gaga uh which is you know if you have a
a again complete nean ring and then you
have a a proper a proper uh scheme over
it then coherent sheaves on that is the
same thing as coherent sheaves on the
formal scheme you get by formally
completing or in other words compatible
collections of coherent sheaves on all
the various n potent thickenings there
um then you would take a spff well maybe
I should say
Spa so in terms of Huber pairs you would
work you would work over this um which
lives over a solid
Z and therefore inherits the notion of
analyics based on
the the closed unit
dis
um it also includes like non-
archimedian GMA
Gaga uh say over I don't know over QP or
any complete non- archimedian field so
there you would take your analytic ring
you would take to be a spec of say QP
solid
um but you wouldn't put the gaseous
structure on it which factors through
the map to spec Z rather you'd put the
gaseous structure on it which
corresponds to mapping topc of Z q hat
plus or minus one Q
gasas uh where Q goes
to uh Q goes to P say so St say standard
choice of topologically mil potent
unit um that's the one that picks out
the notion of analy ification that
corresponds to usual anal analy
ification of algebraic varieties over
your non- archimedian field um you could
have also chosen the other gashes
structure on this guy where you factor
through uh spec Z solid um and that
would give you a different statement of
Gaga in fact a different theorem so yeah
so we're
Mark and three could also
choose
uh the solid
z uh gaseous
structure on uh on solid
QP that gives a an a priori different
Gaga
theorem oh the the analy ification of A1
will then just be the open unit or the
closed unit
dis so um yeah so there's so let me
illustrate H that cannot
beis it has
what
sorry dation
sorry1
ofp
canale so they must
also1 so iation of A1 in that context is
oh wait ah you're right you're right
you're right I'm sorry you're right I'm
sorry yeah that's that that open your
dis is when you just force T to be
analytic but there's no reason
why
uh that should also Force something like
uh T over P to be analytic yeah no ah
same Gaga thank
you yeah I miss uh I I was not the same
guys it's
just no it is the same isn't it because
you you would
make you should always assume that your
whole
ah
you're right I forgot that Axiom shoot
yeah so I'm sorry you need
ah oh boy than uh thanks again so you
need
uh to
assume uh that every element in here is
is bounded
uh
uh yeah
so I was kind of making the same mistake
again over and over um yeah I'm sorry uh
so you don't get a Gaga statement at all
in this context because
um one over p uh is never going to be if
you try to make one over P bounded in
that sense then you're just going to
kill everything so in in the solid QP
setting but nonetheless um there's a
point I wanted to make which is that
there is still a different gaseous
structure on solid QP obtained by taking
um uh obtained by factoring it through
solid zp
and in a sense the difference between
this gaseous ring structure and this
gaseous ring structure is sort of the
difference between usual rigid geometry
and um and some kind of overon
convergent version of rigid
geometry
um
yeah uh
okay
so is there something weaker than
n something weaker than n could you
explain the
question a result that would put uh
identify x r with some
less uh
regular could you explain uh okay maybe
okay yeah this assumption that this uh
bound it yeah yeah
so what is the issue if it's if you
don't assume that it's empty like the if
you don't assume that everything in here
is bounded then when you try to do the
analyics that I described then in
particular you're always forcing all of
the scalers IE elements of of here uh
you're forcing them to be bounded anyway
so if you don't if you don't have this
assumption then your analyics changing
your your base so we have so a special
case is when you take x equals Spec R
and you try to analytify that what this
assumption is saying is basically that
then it doesn't change it like specr is
its own
analytify ring where it's where this
thing has been forced to be bounded but
in the case of solid QP if you try to
force with that with that with that
gaseous structure factoring through
solid Z if you try to force all of the
scalars to be bounded um you're just
going to get the zero ring because
yeah yeah
um
right
yeah um so yeah so that was the
uh yeah x equals specr was giving a
problem there my
apologies
um
okay
uh right
so that was um kind of explaining one
example of where a linear algebraic
comparison result uh can be promoted to
an isomorphism of
stacks um more generally we want
relations um so
relations between the various kinds of
stacks uh various
examples so for already in Peter's talk
he had this map from the T
curve uh with parameter Q to the
topological Circle
so and we want this to make sense as a
map of analytic stacks
so where I already explained how such a
thing is an algebraic stack and
algebraic Stacks will embed into
analytic Stacks even over the the
initial analytic ring um and then we
have the Tate curve and so this kind of
analytic space should map to that kind
of analytic space but also if x is a
complex analytic
space uh then you want
um X to map
to uh its underlying topological Space X
of c
um and if say R is a banak
ring then you want its well sort of its
liquid spec uh to M map to the burkovich
Spectrum
um
so
uh yeah so there's all these we're going
to have all these various different
classes of analytic spaces and we want
the category to be such that we can make
maps between them when we expect
comparisons um so for example it's well
known that the coherent chology of a
comp complex analytic space localizes on
the underlying topological space um
that's kind of more or less by
definition in a lot of ways um and that
kind of linear algebraic relation is
supposed to be explained by the
existence of such a map in this in this
large category of analytic
spaces um so all right
um I
think
uh maybe I'll say one word about the set
theoretic technicalities just to get it
out of the way
um
so so addressing
uh
um
so um well let's go back to our
uh algebraic analog so so this was a
Comm the opposite category of
commutative
Rings um so we have fpqc sheaves on
there but again this is not a legitimate
definition because this is not a small
category and this by definition is a
full subcategory of functors from uh
commutative Rings uh to say sets or
groupoids or whatever you like um and
there's well-known problems with such
things that the
morphisms in this funct category involve
a some more than a sets worth of data so
you have morphisms that aren't sets but
are some sort of bigger entity so that's
a real pain um so what is the
fix
um uh consider so instead
of instead of pre- shees uh on on F
consider uh what are called accessible
prees
um which are the same thing as
accessible
functors uh from commutative rings to
sets and what are accessible
functors
uh if and only if there exists a
cardinal Kappa regular
Cardinal uh such that uh fun F such that
f commutes
with with Kappa filtered
coletes
um so what does this mean uh the the
first choice of Kappa is Alf not
um um and in general when you think of a
regular Cardinal you shouldn't try to
think about what it is as a set what you
should really think of is the collection
of sets that are of smaller cardinality
that's what Kappa is really indexing
it's don't think of it as the
cardinality of some set think of it as
indexing the so this corresponds to
finite
sets um those are the sets of
cardinality smaller than Kappa and then
the notion of Kappa filtered Co limit in
that case is just the usual notion of
filtered Co limit so if your funter
commutes with filtered colimits you're
okay but if Kappa gets
bigger uh you have
fewer uh Kappa filtered Co
limits so to be a so for example if you
take Kaa equals lf1 then you're indexing
the countable
sets and you're only then a Kappa
filtered Co liit would be one where
every countable set has a cone as
opposed to just every finite set so
there are fewer kapper filtered colimits
that means there's more examples of
functors which commute with Kappa
filtered
colimits um and
uh uh
Kappa um so so the nice thing uh is that
every uh for
every X in
F uh the un
uh the on its image under the on
embedding is always
accessible and in
fact
accessible is equivalent to being a
small co-
liit of representable functors
hxs so if we think of
these apine schemes is the basic
building blocks and Co limits as our
gluing procedure then we're saying kind
of an obvious thing we're only allowed
to glue a sets many worth of things
together at a time and that's exactly
what's captured by this notion of
accessible
functor and
moreover uh fpqc shif
foration uh preserves accessible sheaves
or pre- shees
sorry that was actually that's a theorem
of
Waterhouse
um so that um
you can um yeah so you can also impose
the sheath condition at will without
running into set theoretic
technicalities um but this accessible PR
is not presentable right it's not a
presentable C never there
AIC yes okay yeah we have we have to
prove it yeah yeah yeah it has to be
proved so what what makes this work so
these are not kind of in some sense non
trivial claims the claims made here so
what makes this
work so the first thing is that this
category that we're working with uh is
presentable in fact compactly
generated
uh that's what makes the theory of
accessible prees work so it makes that
the condition they're commuting with
Capa filtered col is the same as being a
small cimit of
representes um and then there's
something about the gro de topology
which is that
every uh fpqc
cover
um uh in
F is a a filtered is a there exists a
Kappa such that um and in this case it's
lf1 is a is a Kappa filtered
limit of Kappa comp
compact uh cap fpqc
covers so every uh every flat cover of a
ring is a alf1 filtered Co limit of
countably presented flat covers of that
ring um and this kind of condition
having some a priori bound
on the basic fpqc covers I cardinality
bound is what you can use to um to check
this kind of fpqc shic result and um
so well so maybe I'll say then so
then at
least I we haven't explained what our gr
de topology is but we' least explained
what the category of analytic Rings is
so so there's a theorem um
so analytic
Rings is uh
presentable in fact it's Kappa compactly
generated for
Kappa uh true to the ALF not plus
so
so so that you Capa small means
cardinality less than Continuum um
so the uh that's what lets you kind of
formally avoid all of these uh set
theoretic difficulties involved with
taking pre- sheaves and sheaves on a um
a big
category uh maybe
yeah oh no I won't add anything that's
fine okay thank you for your attention
this category of analytic Rings is
naturally ened of a condensed animal
right I mean
mapping mapping home mapping space
is a condens condens animal yes so we
could also consider ened seeds
instead of usual SE it it seems also
natural to me but you take non-enriched
we take non-enriched yeah and
um it's confusing
the it's
confusing
um what can I
say
um
so in particular this analy the category
of analytic uh Stacks is
not um no it's not that's right
yeah um right different
way because also okay but how do you use
that to get an
enrichment uh
I
mean yeah well maybe there's some
adjoint funter is
there I mean you're saying I mean okay
it's yeah it's not even clear it's
enriched over itself
right
well I mean I don't know yeah but no I
guess I guess you're right you're you're
saying you just take your profinite set
or whatever and then you cross it with X
and map it to y yeah no yeah that's
right yeah so there is an sorry thanks
yeah so you you could take take so in in
analytics tax is enriched over light
condensed sets because you can define an
s-v valued point to be just a a map like
this um but uh it's different from the
enrichment there's essentially no
relation with the enrichment you had on
analytic Rings because we imported these
things via kind of very trivial analytic
Rings just continuous functions and it
um yeah it's all all in all it's a
little bit confusing and um yeah so for
example I think in some recent Works
in in with ptic coefficient systems and
like like V vishan was telling me that
she wants to work with like sheaves of
solid aelan groups on the proall side
site and then you know on the protol
site you already have profinite sets
there so you're somehow you have you're
doing condensed in two orthogonal
directions at the same time but
apparently that's the correct thing for
her and it's just it's it's all a little
bit confusing
but
yeah
yeah I want to explain how this space be
seen as an analytical space um well this
by this I just meant the topological
space um and maybe I make some
assumptions to make sure it's compactly
generated otherwi I mean sorry
metrizable otherwise I have to modify a
little bit what I mean maybe but um yeah
just so the same way that uh that this
thing was a a topological space and
therefore an analytic stack so but this
you could think of as providing an
analytic stack structure on this a
non-trivial analytic stack structure on
this this this topological space
here
yeah um what do you mean by two years
Bond what do I mean by by
one CU is
bounded two is bounded two is bounded ah
yeah so what I meant was that the yeah
so we have some Spec
R and I was looking at the apine line
and then so two is a a function on this
well if you have any element in the
ground ring it gives you a section of
the projection and you can ask that that
section be away from the the local ring
at Infinity so so we had this ring of of
uh ring living at the origin this
filtered cimit of P along scaling the
coordinate by Q then we can put it at
infinity and we can ask that this F not
meet that Locus at Infinity in the sense
that well in the sense that if
you that if you take some relative
tensor product like R mod f and then
that that ring that lives there then you
get zero um
so
um uh right and that if that happens we
say that f is bounded or that f is of
analytic so um it doesn't yeah it
doesn't get too close to
Infinity um so you have to ask that
condition for the scaler two um in order
for some of the claims I made to hold
um yeah and for the Gaga you have to ask
that condition for all elements in the
Basse ring
um
yeah I feel particularly silly about
forgetting that because I mean basically
we we already basically wrote up the
argument in the previous lectures on
complex analytic spaces and that aim was
explicitly included there so I just kind
of forgot about it
um okay other
questions
maybe at Point you said so you wrote
what what was the G structure on Spec R
on Spec R yeah uhhuh said this amount
to Spec
R G GM did it say did I say spec RQ
plusus one I meant spec zq plusus one ah
okay spec oh I'm sorry I'm sorry I meant
Z I meant Z I'm sorry but is it possible
to
elaborate or maybe or
maybe
well I mean the point is that if you
have a map to that stack then you get to
Define such a Ring The Ring of germs at
zero
um uh which lets you run this machine of
of building
analytic so yeah but so why you divide
by G because you don't really want to
specify exactly you don't want to
specify Q so for example you know if you
have like a a tate ring or whatever an
analy T Tate Huber ring or whatever then
there exists a topologically no potent
unit but you know it doesn't play any
role I mean so or at least up to some
bounded difference it doesn't play any
role so that's exactly what this
quotient is doing it's saying you have
some say topologically nil potent unit
um but it shouldn't it should only
matter up to some bounded difference and
so you define this GM analytic and then
you say that if you have q and you
multiply it by something bounded both
both away from zero and away from
Infinity then that should play the same
role in particular it should give rise
to the same item poent algebras and the
same theory of
analytic and so
on by the way I don't see you multiply
by something about it I mean rather that
you can mully by something one or you
raise to raise to some
power but this gets
confus s model is not really antic gen
at
all uh it
is I mean you can have something that's
like Q nor itself but if you multip by
something bound that's too large then
you would actually not have something
anymore yeah but
we that's
true
um that's true wait
uh there but it's not
really I thought I wrote the thing
down
um but maybe we can just
sort I thought I wrote this thing
down um just a
second
ah okay sorry yeah maybe it's not the GM
maybe it's the uh so you can also Define
the locus
where uh the coordinate is bigger than
or equal to one or sorry some in some
over convergent sense and the locus for
T is less than or equal to zero maybe
it's the thing that's uh that lies in
between
there um that's not a yeah that's a
group yeah
um we will discuss later in the
course
yeah but now I'm concerned okay anyway
okay we'll discuss it later in the
course thanks everyone
